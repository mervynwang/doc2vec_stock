",2020-07-27T00:00:00,Nathan BomeyUSA TODAY,"No less than two years ago, Tesla was facing what many considered to be a make-or-break moment.The verdict is in: Tesla made it.The electric vehicle maker turned a surprising profit in the third quarter of 2019, beginning a streak of four straight periods in the black and inspiring confidence in investors that the company's future is bright.Less than a year after Tesla's stock hit a low of $211 in August 2019, the company's shares have soared to stunning new heights, hitting a peak of $1,675 on July 20.Gone are the days of 2018 when Tesla was struggling to produce the Model 3 compact car, burning cash rapidly and prompting serious questions about its ability to survive.The meteoric rise in Tesla's stock price since then has come as the company managed to speed up Model 3 output, launch production of the Model Y crossover, cut unnecessary costs and shake off questions over the leadership of CEO Elon Musk. It has also come despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down Tesla production and undermined the finances of prospective buyers.With the company's short-term survival no longer in question – today it is the most valuable automaker in the world, according to the stock market – it can now turn its attention to charting a long-term path of success.Here are six key storylines to watch that will help determine the company's future.Is your next car a Tesla?:Here's what's next from Elon Musk's electric vehicle companyBig payday:Tesla CEO Elon Musk awarded stock worth more than $700 millionPrice cut:Tesla cuts prices of Model Y electric SUV up to $3,0001. Will people actually buy the Cybertruck?When Tesla initially revealed the futuristic-looking, stainless-steel bodied Cybertruck pickup in November, reactions ranged from ""eccentric"" to ""eye-popping"" to ""weird"" to a ""piece of junk.""Boasting strong technical specifications, including a whopping towing capacity of more than 14,000 pounds, and a promised starting price of about $40,000, the Cybertruck quickly racked up more refundable deposits than Tesla said it expected.But refundable deposits don't necessarily translate into orders. Let's wait to see if buyers actually make the purchase when the vehicle launches production, which was supposed to happen in late 2021. When will that actually begin? That leads us to our next question.2. When will the company's new U.S. factory open?Tesla confirmed July 22 that it had picked the Austin, Texas, area as the site for its second U.S. vehicle assembly plant, which is expected to employ at least 5,000 workers. The plant, which follows the company's factory in Fremont, California, will build the Cybertruck and the Model Y and Model 3 for distribution to the East Coast.Musk told investors on a July 22 earnings call that work is already underway on the plant.But it's unclear when it will be ready to make vehicles. Tesla recently built a new plant in Shanghai in about a year, but the environment for new construction in China is vastly different than the environment in the U.S., where automotive plants typically take two to three years to construct.The faster the plant goes up, the faster Tesla can increase production volume, lower costs and boost sales.3. Can Tesla make a lot of money?This is still an open question. On one hand, the luxury electric vehicles the company has sold so far tend to come with a premium price tag, which translates into premium profits. The Model S sedan and Model X SUV often sell for more than $100,000, for example.But to rack up profits in the long run, the company may need to redesign the aging Model S and Model X and expand its lineup to more affordable vehicles, which will require lowering battery costs. Musk is planning a presentation on Sept. 22 to tell analysts and the media about the company's recent battery advancements.Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn told investors on the earnings call that the company is targeting an operating profit margin in the ""low teens"" in the ""medium term."" But no major automaker has margins above 8% today, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst A.M. (Toni) Sacconaghi, Jr., who said Thursday in a research note that ""it is unclear Tesla will be able to break this barrier, absent unique progress in"" self-driving car technologyWhich leads us to the fourth question.4. Will Tesla's self-driving car technology beat the competition?Tesla has made significant advancements on its so-called Autopilot technology, which enables the car to steer, accelerate, brake and perform other functions on its own, including the ability to navigate some intersections in an automated fashion. But Musk has repeatedly pledged that ""full self-driving"" capability is on the way.""I personally tested the latest alpha build of the full self-driving software when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better than people realize,"" Musk said on the earnings call. ""It's almost getting to a point where I can go from my house to work with no interventions, despite going through construction and widely varying situations.""That capability, if described accurately, is impressive, but a wide range of automotive and tech companies are working on similar technology. Tesla has come under government scrutiny in the past for making over-the-top claims about the capability of its self-driving systems. We'll see if the company can deliver the goods, which would likely help boost profits due to the premium customers are expected to pay for autonomous technology.5. Will the Tesla Semi finally arrive?Musk debuted an electric semi nearly three years ago, bragging that the battery-powered vehicle would revolutionize long-haul shipping. But the vehicle was later sidelined as Tesla was forced to place most of its focus on getting the Model 3 out into the world.Now, the Tesla Semi might finally be on the way. Tesla automotive division president Jerome Guillen said on the earnings call that ""we'll start production next year"" on the Tesla Semi.Competition is bearing down. Upstart truck maker Nikola Corp., which took its moniker after the first name of electricity pioneer Nikola Tesla, recently went public and is making bold declarations about its forthcoming hydrogen semi and electric pickup.Musk, for his part, has called hydrogen fuel cells ""fool cells,"" describing them as overhyped.6. Can Elon Musk avoid further trouble?Musk got himself into hot water in 2018 when he tweeted that he had secured financial commitments to take the company private. The Securities and Exchange Commission later determined that he had not done so. The agency then briefly sought to restrict Musk from ever working again as an executive for Tesla, or any other publicly traded company.He eventually reached a settlement that required him to temporarily relinquish his post as chairman and get his future market-moving tweets pre-approved by legal counsel.Since then, he has continued to needle the SEC, maintaining that the agency enables investors who bet on the company's stock to decline.On July 2, he tweeted that Tesla would ""make fabulous short shorts in radiant red satin with gold trim,"" adding later that he would ""send some to the Shortseller Enrichment Commission to comfort them through these difficult times.""Musk is widely considered to be more important to Tesla than perhaps any other executive to another automaker. So it's critical for him to avoid further legal trouble that could jeopardize his job.Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.",tesla,usatoday,,

This time, however, the scheme secured more than $100,000 in less than an hour.""I'm feeling generous because of Covid-19,"" the fake tweet read on Musk's account. ""I'll double any BTC payment sent to my BTC address for the next hour. Good luck, and stay safe out there!""On Wednesday, Twitter issued a statement: ""We are aware of a security incident impacting accounts on Twitter. We are investigating and taking steps to fix it. We will update everyone shortly.""Soon after that, Twitter posted another tweet that users ""may be unable to Tweet or reset your password while we review and address this incident.""The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it is ""aware"" of the actions, but declined further comment.Since the hack involved high-profile accounts that used multi-factor authentication, it is ""highly likely"" those who executed the action accessed Twitter's underlying application itself, said Michael Borohovski, director of software engineering at cybersecurity company Synopsys, headquartered in Mountain View, California.Some of the accounts — that of cryptocurrency investor Tyler Winklevoss, for example — have confirmed ""they were using multi-factor authentication and got hacked anyway,"" Borohovski said. ""If the hackers do have access to the back-end of Twitter, or direct database access, there is nothing potentially stopping them from pilfering data in addition to using this tweet-scam as a distraction, albeit a very profitable one. We haven't seen data on this, and won't until a post-mortem is released by Twitter, but it's a possibility.The tweets began appearing on the platform around 4:30 p.m. ET, first from notable accounts belonging to Musk and Gates. Later, other high-profile accounts like Bezos and Bloomberg tweeted fraudulent updates, too.More than four hours later, Twitter posted that ""Most accounts should be able to Tweet again.""In subsequent tweets in that thread, the network said the incident was ""what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.""By providing a public address, millions of users who have access to cryptocurrency trading platforms can send as much Bitcoin — in this case, BTC — as they want. In total, the accounts tweeted out to nearly 100 million followers.And some users apparently fell for it: thinking Musk, Gates, and others would double their contribution and send it back, more than 230 transactions were recorded in Bitcoin's public ledger as of 5 p.m. ET. In total, people had sent more than 11 BTC to the address, which is valued at $100,000.As of Wednesday evening, one Bitcoin was worth $9,200.Ryan Toohil, the chief technology officer of digital security firm Aura, says Twitter users should take precautions when using the service. They should strengthen their passwords and use two-factor authentication.""Any big system will have problems, and I think Twitter will get stronger for this,"" he says. ""Big systems are big targets."" Twitter shares took a hit in after-hours trading, falling more than 3% to $34.45.Contributing: Jessica Guynn and Kevin Johnson",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-08-11T00:00:00,Michael Liedtke,"Tesla will split its stock for the first time in its history so more investors can afford to buy a stake in the electric car pioneer following a meteoric rise in its market value.The five-for-one stock split announced Tuesday won't change how much Tesla's business is worth, but will automatically reduce the price of its shares by 80% when it's completed on Aug. 31.The sharp drop in price per shares creates a wider universe of potential investors and also often has the psychological effect of making it seem as if a stock is on sale. Those factors often spark rallies after a split is announced. For instance, Apple's stock price has surged by 14% since the iPhone maker disclosed a four-for-one split less than two weeks ago.More:Coca Cola, Tysons Food among consumer staples to see stocks decline amid coronavirus pandemicMore:Egypt invites Elon Musk to visit after Tesla and SpaceX CEO tweets 'aliens built the pyramids obv'Now, it appears Tesla is about about benefit from the same phenomenon. The company's shares surged 6% to $1,459 in extended trading after the news about the split came out.It marks the first time that Tesla has split its stock since the Palo Alto, California, company went public at $17 per share a decade ago. Any investor who bought $10,000 worth of stock at that IPO price and would now have stock worth about $860,000.Tesla's shares already have tripled so far this year to give the automaker a market value of $256 billion – nearly three times more than the combined value of long-established rivals Ford Motor, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.The rapid run-up in Tesla's stock has been propelled by a widening belief that the company has fixed its past manufacturing problems. It is also seen as moving to widen the appeal of its vehicles beyond the luxury niche with a series of new models.Why did my electric bill go up?

The survey of 1,000 Americans was conducted for Schwab by Logica Research June 25-July 2.“The drop in what Americans think it takes to be wealthy might be a result of people being more grounded about wealth perceptions and goals in such an uncertain environment and coming out of pretty significant market volatility and uncertainty in March and April,"" said Joe Vietri, Schwab’s senior vice president and head of its branch network.As many as 50 million U.S. workers have been laid off, furloughed or seen their hours or pay reduced during the pandemic, according to unemployment benefit claims tracked by the Labor Department. Many of those affected are low- and middle-income households who work in the restaurant, hotel and retail industries, which largely shut down in March after most states issued stay-at-home orders to curtail the spread of the virus.States are gradually reopening, though many have partly closed down again after infection spikes. Retail spending plummeted in April but rebounded sharply in May and June. Much of the comeback has been linked to higher-income Americans who largely have been able to work from home during the shutdown.Overall, 57% ofAmericans have been financially impacted by the pandemic, including 68% of millennials, the survey found.

Operating income for the division was $3.1 billion. That is up year over year from $2.2 billion.While AWS is not Amazon’s largest unit, it is the fastest growing. Furthermore, the AWS operating margin of 30% is massive compared to the other divisions of Amazon.The size of the global cloud computing market is over $260 billion, and it is expected to grow by 10% to 29% over the next five years. AWS is the top company in cloud market share, which is why the division is so valuable. The number two company, based on most analyses, is Microsoft Corp..Because of the size of the market, Amazon is unlikely to hit a wall in revenue growth, even with its number one spot.One thing some investors like most about AWS is that it markets to business and not consumers. Amazon consumer-based e-commerce is more vulnerable to drops in consumer spending.Amazon’s more well-known businessesAmazon dominates the online retail industry in the United States. It has contributed to the decline of brick-and-mortar retail, which has triggered the loss of tens of thousands of American jobs, industry analysts and economists say.Retail sales have continued to move online.

That streaming media service is part of a crowded marketplace.Amazon also has a strong consumer electronics business based on artificial intelligence products that consumers use in their homes. Its Alexa voice-activated software can control home entertainment and communications. Amazon has an estimated 75% of the global smart speaker market. Most of the Alexa home products are sold under the Dot brand.It is almost certain these same products will enter the business sector. That will create a new business-to-business operation for Amazon’s artificial intelligence.Does Amazon have a fourth business?It could be argued that Amazon has a fourth business, even though it does not break out any financial data for the operation. The company has started to sell online advertising. This puts it into competition with Google and Facebook.Amazon’s share of digital market dollars in the United States is projected to rise as high as 10%.

Work on the plant, which will be over 4 million square feet, is already underway, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said.He did not put a number on how many vehicles the facility would produce. “Long term, a lot,” Musk said.Tesla profit:Electric car company makes $104M profit in second quarter despite shutdown for pandemicMore earnings:Microsoft weathers coronavirus pandemic, beats Wall Street expectationsThe company has pledged to invest $1.1 billion and said it will pay a minimum wage of $15 per hour to employees and provide health insurance, paid leave and other benefits.The area that’s home to the University of Texas at Austin and tech companies such as Dell Inc. was a candidate for the plant all along, but Tulsa, Oklahoma, emerged in mid-May as another possibility.Tesla doesn’t have a lot of time to get the factory running if it wants to meet target production dates. The company says on its website that the Cybertruck will be available starting late next year. Tesla has often missed promised production dates in the past.Musk has reportedly been happy with Texas, where his SpaceX rocket company has operations in Brownsville and in McGregor north of Austin.The new factory will be Tesla’s biggest so far, although it may not employ as many workers as the 10,000 at its factory in Fremont, California. The electric car maker has said it wants the new factory to be in the center of the country and closer to eastern markets.The Fremont factory currently is Tesla’s only U.S. assembly plant. It has a second U.S. factory in Reno, Nevada, where it builds batteries for its vehicles and employs about 6,500 people. Tesla also has a factory in Shanghai and another one under construction in Germany.Musk has been unhappy with California, where earlier this year he flouted local orders to stay closed to help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. Musk has threatened to move the company’s headquarters out of Palo Alto and all future vehicles out of the plant in Fremont, a reworked factory that once was run jointly by Toyota and General Motors.Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has not allowed cities and counties to impose local orders that would close businesses as the virus began surging to record levels this summer. The state did not give Tesla any additional financial incentives, Abbott spokesman John Wittman said.“Tesla is one of the most exciting and innovative companies in the world, and we are proud to welcome its team to the State of Texas,” Abbott said in a statement.Texas has no corporate or individual income taxes. It also touts the region’s young workforce as one of the most educated in the country. Nearly 47% of adults have at least a bachelor’s degree, pushing Austin into the top 10 among large metro areas, the site says. But at present, Tesla can’t legally sell its vehicles in Texas. A state law requires cars to be sold through franchised dealers, not company stores like Tesla operates.Tulsa put up a good fight, but may have been used to win better terms from Texas. Oklahoma boasts about its low tax rates and cost of living, particularly low utility costs. Musk even visited the Tulsa site earlier this month.Oklahoma hasn’t had an auto manufacturer in the state since General Motors shuttered its Oklahoma City facility in 2005, but Tulsa is home to an American Airlines maintenance facility that employs about 5,200 workers.Associated Press writer Paul J.

",2020-07-23T00:00:00,Michael Liedtke,"SAN RAMON, Calif. – Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is launching a legal attack against Google’s YouTube video site for allowing con artists to use him as a pawn in a Bitcoin scam believed to have heisted millions of dollars from people around the world.The personal computer pioneer vented his frustration and anger in a video conference held Thursday to explain why he decided to sue one of the world’s biggest internet companies in a California state court earlier this week. The suit also represents 17 alleged victims of the bitcoin scam, including 10 people who live outside the U.S.The 47-page complaint revolves around a ruse that has used images of Wozniak and high-tech celebrities such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk to trick people out of the digital currency Bitcoin. Videos spread on YouTube as part of the scheme entice viewers to send their bitcoins to an anonymous digital address, promising to return double that amount. The return payment never arrives.Facebook CEO:Mark Zuckerberg gets 'Dear Mark' video from Facebook boycott organizers5G advance:AT&T takes its 5G wireless network nationwide as evolution to super-fast connections continueIt’s similar to a scam that surfaced on Twitter last week when hackers hijacked the accounts of more than 100 prominent people, including Gates, Musk, former President Barack Obama and Joe Biden, this year’s Democratic Party nominee for president. Twitter was able to regain control of the hacked accounts and purge the scam from its messaging service within a few hours.Wozniak, though, said he has been trying to get Google and YouTube to prevent videos peddling the scam with his name and picture in it since May 10. But the site can’t seem to stop the blatant ruse from repeatedly reappearing on the site after a bogus clip is removed, he said.“It’s like Whack-A-Mole,” Wozniak said. “You can never reach a human who would easily understand the situation and get it rectified by some method. Anybody would look at that and say it’s a crime. We never got to a human. Maybe I could pull some strings, but I don’t believe in pulling strings.”Both Wozniak and one of his lawyers, Joseph Cotchett, urged U.S. lawmakers to confront Google CEO Sundar Pichai about why YouTube hasn’t done more to stop fraudulent activity on his site when he testifies before Congress in a hearing scheduled for Monday, July 27.YouTube said it removed 2.2 million videos and terminated 1.7 million accounts during the first three months of this year for violating its policies against deceptive practices. But it had no comment about Wozniak’s specific charges.“We take abuse of our platform seriously, and take action quickly when we detect violations of our policies,” YouTube said in a Thursday statement.Why did my electric bill go up?

Finding your carrier’s flavor of 5G requires a taste for investigation  The Daily Money: Subscribe to our newsletterA former Yahoo executive who now runs a digital currency company, Brad Garlinghouse, filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube and Google in April alleging much the same misconduct that Wozniak cited in his complaint.Both lawsuits allege that YouTube allows scams to appear on its site because the viewers they attract help sell the site’s digital ads, which overall generated $15 billion in revenue for Google last year.Although Google’s search engine serves as the company’s most lucrative advertising channel, YouTube has been playing an increasingly important role during the past few years as people watch more video online instead of traditional TV.In a response to Garlinghouse’s lawsuit on Monday, YouTube said it cannot be held liable for the scam video under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 24-year-old law that protects internet companies from being held responsible for material posted by third parties so long as they promptly remove illegal content . YouTube will try to persuade a judge to dismiss Garlinghouse’s lawsuit during a hearing scheduled next month.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-07-29T00:00:00,Glenn Harlan Reynolds,"“I’m not saying that it’s aliens. But it’s aliens.”That’s the tagline of a famous internet meme based on Giorgio Tsoukalos’ History channel show, “Ancient Aliens.” But now it seems to be the official United States government line, too.Just this past week came the latest slow-roll disclosure about UFOs and aliens in The New York Times, which, in the words of tech blog Gizmodo, ""casually drops another story about how aliens are probably real.”There are even reports that the Pentagon has obtained vehicles or parts of vehicles ""not made on this Earth,"" though former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was either misquoted confirming the story or walked back his comments to that effect later.I’m old enough to remember when speculation about UFOs was limited to the fringe and when respectable figures and publications wouldn’t touch it. But a few months ago, the Navy released UFO videos, and since then more stories keep appearing, suggesting at the very least that the U.S. government is taking the possibility of aliens visiting Earth a lot more seriously than has been the case in the past.  Life, on other planets? A great possibilityWell, maybe there’s something here and maybe there’s not. It wouldn’t shock me to find that our vast universe harbors other intelligent life, nor would it surprise me to find that just because we don’t know how to travel between the stars yet, others have figured it out.But what would aliens look like if we met them? Well, there might be some sorts of intelligent life that we’d never contact: Electromagnetic creatures that live on neutron stars, for example, would be extraordinarily difficult to discover or communicate with. But, basically, the more alien species have in common with us, the more likely they are to visit Earth if they’re able to. Carbon-based life forms would be more likely to be interested in planets suitable for carbon-based life; oxygen breathers would be more likely to visit a planet with an oxygen atmosphere, etc.We’re conspicuous enough to anyone who’s looking: Commercial broadcasting has been going on for a hundred years now, meaning that anyone within a volume 200 light years across could find us if they looked. (We haven’t found radio signals from anyone else, but while that might mean there’s no one out there, it might also mean that they’ve advanced beyond the use of radio waves.)Not even aliens would surprise usIf aliens do come to see us, what are they likely to be like? Well, to get here they have to be at least as intelligent as us. And as Gregg Easterbrook noted in The Atlantic awhile back in 1988, that’s troubling: “The most disquieting aspect of natural selection as observed on Earth is that it channels intellect to predators. Most bright animals are carnivores: Stalking requires tactics, pattern recognition and, for social animals, coordinated action, all incubators of brainpower.”And violence. We can hope, of course, that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization might have evolved past violence, though the evidence that our civilization is doing so is not entirely compelling.Good news from Washington:America's parks are on verge of major improvementsProbably the best we can hope for, if aliens are visiting Earth, is that they’re studying us. And a lot of the encounters may be explained by what some of my science-fiction writer friends call the “graduate student hypothesis”: We’re being studied, but, as on Earth, the big shot scientists leave most of the grubby fieldwork to grad students, who occasionally get bored, or drunk, and decide to have a little fun spooking the natives.One thing that may have been true when Easterbrook wrote, but that I think is much less so now, is the notion that encountering aliens would be a huge culture shock. There was a time when we took it for granted that humans were alone in the universe at the top of the evolutionary heap — above us were only the angels. But decades of science fiction have surely undermined that. Given the number of alien contact movies in the past few decades, it is more likely that angels visiting Earth would be greeted as aliens than that aliens visiting Earth would be greeted as angels.A new era:The Space Age is making a comeback, but it's cheaper this time with SpaceX.Certainly, the surprisingly low-key response to what in the past would have been earthshaking UFO revelations suggests that we’re psychologically ready to handle alien contact without the kind of trauma that might have marked an earlier time. And let’s face it, if they’re coming, 2020 is the perfect year for them to arrive, since it has piled one unlikely event on top of another. From murder hornets to a global pandemic to alien invasion ... it just feels right, somehow.Welcome to Earth, alien visitors. Watch out for the murder hornets.Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of ""The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,"" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors. ",tesla,usatoday,,

We asked these titans of industry and Advisors in The Oracles, who are in industries ranging from real estate to technology and fitness. Here’s their best advice for preparing your life and business for the future.1. Reevaluate your priorities.This situation makes us reevaluate our priorities and cut back on expenses. Then when things turn around, you’ll be prepared to thrive because you aren’t wasting money on excess.These times are difficult, and I wouldn’t wish them on anyone, but they also offer opportunities. When the stock market goes down, that’s when you buy. For example, I bought Bitcoin when it dropped recently. This is also about more than finances; it’s about focusing on what’s important, like family, and getting back to the basics in life.Graduating from college during the pandemic? These business titans have some advice for youHow to raise entrepreneurial kids:According to Mark Cuban, Tony Hawk and 9 entrepreneursWe’re learning that in extreme ways right now and will be better off for it. We just have to stay positive. —Tony Hawk, founder and CEO of Birdhouse Skateboards and president of the Tony Hawk Foundation; the most influential and commercially successful skateboarder of all time, with a $100+ million net worth2. Take advantage of financial resources.If you’re worried about your finances, take advantage of all the resources out there. Do your homework on the benefits available to you under the CARES Act. Your biggest priorities should be paying for essentials and eliminating unnecessary expenses. Try to refinance your mortgage, or call your landlord if you’ll have trouble making rent. If you have a lot of credit card debt, pay it down now, starting with the highest-interest cards.The best investment you can make is in yourself right now. With unemployment skyrocketing, reinvent yourself as a more desirable job candidate.Take online courses and learn new skills so you can repackage yourself for a new economy when we come out of this. —Barbara Corcoran, founder of The Corcoran Group, podcast host of “Business Unusual,” and Shark on “Shark Tank”; follow Barbara on Instagram and Facebook3. Adapt to sustain your business.To sustain your business through these challenging times, forget your plans. It’s time to adapt. Consider ways to digitize your products and services; for instance, virtualize your events or offer digital downloads instead of physical products. Use technology to systematize your processes so you’re less dependent on people. Cash is king in a crisis, so look at your cash balance daily. Collect from those who owe you, renegotiate payment terms with those you owe, and suspend nonessential spending. Prioritize retaining your existing customers over new business. Ask how you can help them with their challenges.If needed, ask what you can do differently to keep them, such as deferring their payments. Finally, stay calm. You can’t make intelligent decisions if you’re panicking. —Dan Lok, founder of the Dan Lok Organization and two dozen companies, including Closers.com and Copywriters.com; chairman of Dragon 100, bestselling author, and venture capitalist; connect with Dan on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram4. Embrace the situation.A recession doesn’t indicate the end of times, but a shift in people’s needs from the want-to-haves to the must-haves. Like past recessions, this one will birth many great companies and new millionaires. You can choose to be upset, wait it out, or rely on a government bail-out — or you can embrace the new normal, identify the new opportunities, and reposition accordingly.With a positive mindset, problem-solving, and hard work, this can become one of the best periods in your career. There has never been a better time to be an entrepreneur. In a thriving economy, people are bombarded with marketing messages and struggle to decide where to spend money.Now, advertising is quiet (buying ads is a bargain), and our needs are crystal clear. If your business addresses those needs the way companies like Zoom, Netflix, and UberEats do, you can thrive. —Mike Peters, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and founder of the Yomali group of companies, which has generated more than $1 billion in sales online; connect with Mike on LinkedIn5. Focus on solving problems.When attacking any problem, your mindset determines your outcome. With a poor attitude, you get a poor result. With a strong mindset, you’re more likely to get what you want. Money doesn’t go away in a recession; it just changes hands. So figure out who has money, what new problems they’re facing, and what you can sell them to solve those problems.For example, people still need to stay fit while gyms are closed; so personal trainers who started coaching online are thriving.You also must understand how to drive traffic to your website through social media and advertising. In good times and bad, you’ll succeed if you know how to get traffic that converts into paying clients. —Bedros Keuilian, founder of Fit Body Boot Camp, author of “Man Up,” and host of “Empire Podcast Show”; connect with Bedros on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube6. Invest in yourself and level up.Right now, there is little “fear of missing out.” No one is getting together, partying, or brunching nearly as much. What we’re going through will not happen again in your lifetime, so use this time to level up.Don’t be complacent. Find a new hobby, read a book, take an online class, and do things in the now. Focus on you and invest in yourself, and you’ll accomplish anything you set your mind to. —Zain Kheraj, co-founder and CFO of TrustMySystem, a sports consulting and analytics company7. Keep exercising and learning.Start each day with a plan and hold yourself accountable. I’ve had to pivot in many ways, but what hasn’t changed is my commitment to exercise, which is critical to staying positive and focused. I like to go for a run or walk. If you don’t, do 15 minutes of floor exercises like planks, jumping jacks, or core work while listening to your favorite sweat songs.Like many of us, I’ve become dependent on my devices, so I’m using them to learn. Use a motivational app or stream an inspirational talk, such as Glennon Doyle on “Unlocking Us with Brené Brown” or Antoni Lacinai at TEDxVasa. Breathe deeply and tell the universe what you’re thankful for.We can have post-traumatic stress from this situation or post-traumatic growth. You decide. This could be the incubation period you need to unlock your gifts. —Holly Parker, founder and CEO of The Holly Parker Team at Douglas Elliman; award-winning broker who has made over $8 billion in sales; connect with Holly on LinkedIn and Instagram8. Prepare for the best- and worst-case scenarios.It’s hard to say what the future holds, but times like these can benefit those who make it through. Lots of the world’s most successful companies grew out of recessions, such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb, Disney, and many more. Recessions brim with opportunities because comparatively few seize them. It’s important to recognize that there’s a good chance this coming decade will be very different from the last. Don’t assume that assets that performed well in the past will continue to. Buy some gold instead of just Tesla stock.If you’re running a company, make conservative enough decisions that you’re in a position to thrive if things get worse.At the same time, invest as heavily in growth as you can afford to. Keep enough cash in your company’s bank account and then shoot for the stars. —Judd Rosenblatt, founder and CEO of AE Studio, an agile web development and data science consulting firm with a mission to increase human agency with technology; vote for the charity they donate to next month9. Keep working hard.The world will always be changing, so you need to be able to change with it. Focus on innovation and adapting to what’s happening around you. Whether you’re learning a new skill or sharpening your craft, do not stop leveling up with a sense of urgency.Anything in life that’s worth it takes time and effort, so you have to do the work. Like the billionaire CEO Elon Musk says: Work like hell. Put in 80 to 100 hours every week. This improves your odds of success. —Farhaz Kheraj, co-founder and CEO of TrustMySystem, a sports consulting and analytics company10. Don’t give up.Stay agile and ready to pivot. Those who will come out of this situation on top will be making moves constantly. That means communicating openly with clients and exploring other avenues for revenue and ways to stay in business. Consider how to use your team best. Is everyone in the right place?Can anyone contribute differently with underutilized skills? Now is the time to assess everything you have going for you and what you’re missing. Get creative and keep pushing forward, no matter what.  —Bill Gerber, co-founder of AccountingDepartment.com, a virtual accounting service for small businesses; connect with Bill on LinkedInWant to share your insights in a future article?Join The Oracles, a mastermind group of the world’s leading entrepreneurs who share their success strategies to help others grow their businesses and build better lives.

",2020-07-21T00:00:00,Pan Pylas,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:000:21ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenLONDON (AP) — Amber Heard dismissed accusations Tuesday that she fabricated allegations of domestic violence against ex-husband Johnny Depp, and told a British court that the first time she struck him after years of abuse was to defend her sister from being thrown down the stairs.Taking to the witness box for a second day during Depp’s libel case against a British tabloid at the High Court in London, the actress faced a barrage of questions over alleged incidents that are central to The Sun's labeling of Depp in an April 2018 article as a “wife beater.”She also admitted striking Depp for the first time in March 2015, after years of alleged abuse, to defend her sister, Whitney. When asked whether she had punched Depp “with a closed fist,” Heard conceded she had struck him after he had hit both of them.“He was about to push her down the stairs and the moment before that happened, I remembered information I had heard that he pushed a former girlfriend — I believe it was Kate Moss — down the stairs."" she said. Depp dated the top model in the 1990s.Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard:All the nasty bits of the UK trial — and it's all nasty“I will never forget this incident,"" she said. “It was the first time after all these years.”Depp’s counsel, Eleanor Laws, wondered why Heard had not mentioned the Moss allegation previously.“I’ve not had the liberty of time or space or energy even to list every thought that crossed my mind,” Heard said.Depp, 57, is suing The Sun’s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard, and claimed in court that she had been violent to him. He was present to hear Heard's testimony.His lawyer sought to show inconsistencies in Heard's allegations, accusing her of weaving a “web of lies” and “making this up as you go along.”Heard, 34, insisted through the day that she was being truthful.“I can just tell you after everything I had been through; I had been strangled, punched, sexually assaulted, among other things,"" she said.Laws made much of a series of video clips from an elevator at the couple’s Los Angeles apartment building that she claimed showed no evidence of any injuries on Heard's face after an incident on May 21, 2016, which ended up with police arriving on the scene. Laws also wondered why others in the building did not notice injuries in the days after.The actress has alleged that Depp threw a phone at her “like he was a baseball pitcher,” hitting her on the right cheek and eye. She said she wears makeup when leaving home that could have camouflaged signs of an injury.Heard also denied she had an “illicit relationship” with anyone during her time with Depp, specifically with either Tesla CEO Elon Musk or actor James Franco. “Not that that matters much,” Heard said.Laws read out text messages on May 22, 2016, in which Heard allegedly tells Musk she is going to obtain a restraining order against Depp, and the billionaire offers to “arrange 24/7 security."" Musk allegedly said the offer would stand, ""even if you never wanted to see me again ... anyway, sorry for being an idiot. The radio silence hurts a lot. It only matters because I really like you.”Depp and Heard met on the set of the comedy “The Rum Diary,” released in 2011. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and it was finalized in 2017.In the first nine days of testimony at the High Court, judge Andrew Nicol heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who backed his version of events. In his testimony, Depp said he was the one being abused by Heard and that she had a history of being violent against him.Via audio recordings of the couple discussing various incidents played in court, Depp’s lawyer sought to show that Heard admitted she had been violent against Depp. Heard said any contact was purely self-defense.“I knew better than to fight with him about the details of the fight, and what he perceived as injuries to him,"" she said. ""My job was to say sorry and get him on track, and move on to bigger things.”Heard denied the allegation made in court in the first week of the trial that she, or one of her friends, defecated on the couple's bed the morning after her 30th birthday party in April 2016.“That’s absolutely disgusting,” Heard said. “I can’t imagine what kind of human being would have a sense of humor like that, other than Johnny, but I don’t think that’s funny, I think it’s horrific.”Heard suggested the feces came from one of their Yorkshire Terriers, Pistol and Boo, but that Boo had had issues ever since he had allegedly eaten some of Depp's marijuana as a puppy, or as she phrased it “since the weed.”In written testimony released to the court, Heard said that at various times during their relationship she endured “punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking.” She said some incidents were “so severe” she was ""afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far.” She said he blamed his actions on “a self-created third party” that he referred to as “the monster.”Heard's testimony is expected to last for four days, through Thursday.",tesla,usatoday,,

You need to learn and implement some basic investing concepts. Keep it simple. Even acing “Investing 101” strategies will help you achieve goals like saving for a home, boosting your 401(k) balance so you can retire in style, or becoming a millionaire.Here are 10 investing tips that financial advisors say can help beginner investors build wealth over the long haul.Tip No. 1Start earlyWhen it comes to investing, time is your friend.“When should you start investing? The answer is as soon as possible,” says Blair duQuesnay, investment advisor at Ritholtz Wealth Management in New Orleans.The more time your money is invested, the more time it has to grow. The beauty of investing is you earn interest on the interest you’ve already earned on your initial investment -- a concept known as “compound interest.” Legendary scientist Albert Einstein reportedly once said that compound interest is “the eighth wonder of the world” and “the most powerful force in the universe.”More:Looking to help your investments in a recession? Experts recommend these stocksMore:This is how Warren Buffett says to invest: 'Consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund'A calculation done by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis highlights the winning math behind compounding. An investor who starts saving at age 25 and invests $5,000 a year for 10 years in a row and earns 8% per year would accumulate $787,180 by age 65. In contrast, someone that begins investing 10 years later at age 35 and sets aside $5,000 a year for 30 years would have just $611,730 at age 65.""It’s like a snowball effect,” duQuesnay says. “The longer you are invested the more you benefit.”Tip 2Go for growthThere’s a big difference between saving and investing. Investing is about taking some risk to reap higher potential returns.Large U.S. stocks, for example, generated compound annual returns of 10% in the 93 years ending in 2018, according to Morningstar. In contrast, a 20-year government bond returned 5.5% per year and 30-day Treasury bills gained 3.3 per annum. During that period, $1 invested in large stocks grew to $7,030, versus just $142 for the long-term bond and $21 for the Treasury bill.“Historically, investing in the stock market outperforms having your money sitting in cash,” says Dominique Broadway, founder of Finances De-mys-ti-fied.Tip 3Focus on your 401(k)If you just landed a job and your employer offers a 401(k) retirement plan, make sure you enroll. It’s an easy way to regularly sock away money that you’ll need when you stop working decades from now.One benefit of a 401(k) is you’ll automatically have a portion of each paycheck go directly into your retirement savings plan, which offers a menu of diversified investment options to choose from. Since contributions in a traditional 401(k) are made with pre-tax dollars, you’ll also lower your tax bill. Another plus is most employers also contribute to your 401(k) via matching contributions.“The first thing I would do as a young investor at a new job is to find out exactly what the 401(k) plan offers, (and) what the match is,” says Broadway.Ideally, you want to contribute enough to your 401(k) to be eligible for the full company match.The average company match was 4.7%, a Fidelity study found last year. “The company match is like getting an extra paycheck sent to your retirement account,” says duQuesnay.Tip 4Keep it simple     No clue how to pick the right stocks or mutual funds? Or how to build a diversified portfolio? Don’t worry about it.Most 401(k) plans offer “target-date” funds. These funds do all the work for you. They pick the individual investments like stocks and bonds, as well as make sure your holdings are diversified and not too risky for your age.“Target-date funds are a great place to start,” Broadway says.Here’s how these funds work. You pick a target year that’s closest to the year you’ll think you’ll stop working. For example, you’d invest in a “2050 Fund” if you plan on retiring 30 years from now. As you move closer to your retirement target date, the fund will lower your fund’s risk profile by reducing the percentage of more volatile stocks and shift the money into safer investments like bonds and cash.“Rather than having to pick individual funds and decide how much you want to contribute to each one all by yourself, they do it for you,” duQuesnay says.Tip 5Put your savings on autopilotWhat you don’t want to do is put off saving until tomorrow. To avoid procrastination, set your long-term investments on autopilot, advises Scott Pedvis, a financial advisor with Wells Fargo Advisors in New York City. “Automate your investments,” Pedvis says. If you aren’t already saving automatically in your 401(k) via payroll deductions at work, set up a system where money is taken out of your checking account and moved into your investment account on a predetermined date each month.“It forces you to save, and takes the emotion out of investing,” says Pedvis, adding that automatic savings also removes the temptation to try to time the market, or get in and out at precisely the right time, which is difficult.Tip 6Don’t put all your eggs in one basketThink Tesla will dominate the electric car space forever? Well, even if you do, don’t invest every penny of your money in Elon Musk’s company.Why? If you’re wrong and Tesla’s stock tanks, you won’t have anything else in your portfolio to cushion the financial fall. The concept of owning a wide variety of investments is known as diversification. Your much better off investing in funds that own many stocks in different businesses or a variety of interest-paying bonds to spread your risk around.“Diversification doesn’t mean guaranteed returns or no volatility,” says Pedvis. “The idea is to smooth out the ride.”Tip 7Figure out your ‘pain’  thresholdTry to determine your maximum pain threshold, or how big a loss you can endure without bailing out of the market at the wrong time.“The biggest mistake beginners make is forgetting that it is a long-term investment,” says Broadway. “New investors may immediately see their account values fall, get nervous, and sell their investments. Patience is key.”To gauge your true tolerance for risk, Pedvis suggests the following exercise: “Imagine you had $100,000 invested in stocks and the market fell and your account balance fell by $30,000. How are you feeling? Are you losing sleep? Do you not really care?” If a potential loss of that size stresses you out, it’s signaling that you might need to trim the risk in your portfolio.Tip 8Try to save at least 10% of your income“A good rule of thumb is to try to save 10% to 15% of your pay in your retirement plan,” says duQuesnay. (Include any company match in calculating your savings rate.)If you can’t save that much at the start, gradually increase your savings annually, she advises.“Some 401(k) plans have a feature known as ‘auto-escalation,’ where you agree today to save more tomorrow and your company’s plan will automatically increase the portion of your paycheck deducted each year,” says duQuesnay.Tip 9Don’t listen to punditsTurn off the financial news. Bears warning of a market meltdown might spook you out of the market at the wrong time. And bulls predicting that the market will double might make you overly optimistic and vulnerable to a big selloff if you go all in.“A big mistake beginner investors make is taking what’s said by others as gospel,” says Pedvis.Tip 10Seek help if you need itAnd if you just don’t feel comfortable getting started on your own, ask for help, adds Pedvis.“A lot of investing can be done independently, but not everything in your life can be do it yourself,” Pedvis says.You can get help from a financial planner or advisor, an accountant or lawyer, or people in your life that have success managing money, he says.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-07-20T00:00:00,Adam Shell,"Newsflash for investing newbies: You don’t need a Ph.D. in finance to start saving for retirement or other long-term goals.   But you can’t rely on beginner’s luck either. You need to learn and implement some basic investing concepts. Keep it simple. Even acing Investing 101 strategies will help you achieve goals like saving for a home, boosting your 401(k) balance so you can retire in style, or becoming a millionaire. Here are 10 investing tips that financial advisers say can help beginner investors build wealth over the long haul. Tip No. 1: Start early When it comes to investing, time is your friend.  “When should you start investing? The answer is as soon as possible,” says Blair duQuesnay, investment adviser at Ritholtz Wealth Management in New Orleans. The more time your money is invested, the more time it has to grow. The beauty of investing is you earn interest on the interest you’ve already earned on your initial investment – a concept known as “compound interest.” Legendary scientist Albert Einstein reportedly once said that compound interest is “the eighth wonder of the world” and “the most powerful force in the universe.” Coronavirus stimulus:The next deal will have a big changeUber drivers, artists, freelancers:Here's how to get an $1,000 from coronavirus stimulus fundsA calculation done by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis highlights the winning math behind compounding. An investor who starts saving at age 25 and invests $5,000 a year for 10 years in a row and earns 8% per year would accumulate $787,180 by age 65. In contrast, someone that begins investing 10 years later at age 35 and sets aside $5,000 a year for 30 years would have just $611,730 at age 65.  “It’s like a snowball effect,” duQuesnay says. “The longer you are invested the more you benefit.” Tip 2: Go for growth There’s a big difference between saving and investing. Investing is about taking some risk to reap higher potential returns.  Large U.S. stocks, for example, generated compound annual returns of 10% in the 93 years ending in 2018, according to Morningstar. In contrast, a 20-year government bond returned 5.5% per year and 30-day Treasury bills gained 3.3 per annum. During that period, $1 invested in large stocks grew to $7,030, versus just $142 for the long-term bond and $21 for the Treasury bill. “Historically, investing in the stock market outperforms having your money sitting in cash,” says Dominique Broadway, founder of Finances De-mys-ti-fied.  Tip 3: Focus on your 401(k) If you just landed a job and your employer offers a 401(k) retirement plan, make sure you enroll.

Since contributions in a traditional 401(k) are made with pre-tax dollars, you’ll also lower your tax bill.

The plan expands GEO's immigration detention capacity in Kern County by 350%.The modified permits for the facilities were slated to take effect July 15, according to court filings.But U.S. District Judge Troy Nunley on Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order, barring the city of McFarland from modifying the permits for the two facilities, and preventing The GEO Group from transferring any immigrants into or out of the facilities until he rules on an outside request for a preliminary injunction.Vacation rental demand soars, water wars and the elusive sturgeonThe demand for vacation rentals, particularly in non-urban areas, is rising as people seek closer-to-home destinations and want to avoid hotels.A contentious legal battle that puts competing Western public agencies at odds over who gets precious Colorado River water gets underway in court. The curious case of the long-living, giant sturgeon that dwell in the deepest waters of Lake Shasta, and why it's so rare to see one.Some schools can 'safely reopen,' state education chief saysTeachers, parents and administrators continue to wrestle with the difficult decision of what to do when the new school year starts up, whether it's in Ventura County or Tulare County. The Los Angeles and San Diego school districts said earlier this week they'll start the school year off virtually, while Orange County plans to allow some students to return. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond on Wednesday applauded the decisions by L.A. and S.D. not to reopen but said the same rules need not apply in counties with low rates of infection.He called for “an abundance of caution"" as many of California’s 1,000 school districts finalize plans for the new school term but stressed there was no one-size-fits-all template for reopening schools. Many small, rural communities argue they shouldn’t have to comply with the same rules as big cities, where infection rates are higher, and Thurmond indicated Wednesday he agreed. “We have some counties in this state where the number of cases is actually quite low,” he said. “Schools in those counties will actually be able to open and, if they’re following the guidance that our experts have provided ... we believe that those schools can open safely.” 🎧. LISTEN: The president of the Association of California School Administrators talks to host Carl Cohn on the EdSource podcast, ""Schools on the Frontlines.""Sandwiches will be served here, a Twitter hack and no Rose Parade in '21 At least two delis are staying open in Redding despite state orders to shut down.

""It is on our mind a lot just like every citizen of the world.""The three of us (like) most astronauts have the ability to focus on our work and compartmentalize when we need to be sharp and safe and diligent about the task at hand,"" he said in an interview Tuesday with USA TODAY from the space station. ""But when it’s off duty time we’re quick to find the latest news from our hometowns, our families and find out what’s going on ... and we hope all the best of health for everyone.""The three have been together for 37 days, ever since Behnken and Hurley made history by docking their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule to the ISS on May 31 following a 19-hour flight. Their 27-foot capsule, launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 30 at 3:22 EST,  became the first spacecraft to carry humans from U.S. soil to the orbiting lab since NASA ended its Space Shuttle program in 2011 – and the first private one carrying humans ever to do so..For nearly a decade, NASA has relied on Moscow to ferry astronauts to the space station. Hurley praised the Russians for being ""incredible"" partners but called the resumption of U.S-based flights ""far overdue.""""It was a tough proposition to swallow back in 2011 when the last shuttle flight flew and we had no capability from the United States to launch us into space,"" he said. ""It’s great to be back in that business again.""Plans for an early to mid-August return – which will include the first splashdown of a U.S. crew in 45 years – remain a working target but it's too early to pin down a specific date, Behnken told USA TODAY.More:How Elon Musk took SpaceX from an idea to the cusp of making history""Looking at the Gulf or off the coast of Florida in August and September, you do need to wait until you have good forecasts before you can plan too far into it, just with hurricanes, thunderstorms and the dynamics that are out there,"" he said. ""We’ve got another two weeks or so and then a good plan ought to start coming together because the weather will be better understood.""The crew is scheduled to conduct at least two more space walks to finish work that Cassidy and Benkhen started with earlier space walks to upgrade the batteries providing power to the station’s solar arrays.In between station tasks, Hurley has been in the ISS cupola, taking breathtaking photos of his home planet and sharing them on social media.""Personally, it’s trying to convey to as many people as we can just what we see with our eyes when we look out the window up here and how different it is to view the earth from space then to be standing on the Earth somewhere,"" he said.Even with the ISS traveling at five miles per second and orbiting Earth about every 90 minutes, Hurley has little trouble recognizing the Rockies, the Himalayas or the turquoise sheen of the Caribbean.""Every time we fly over the Bahamas, that vivid blue that you see that surrounds those islands is just unbelievable,"" he said.For Hurley, the docking is familiar. In 2011, he was on the final space shuttle mission's rendezvous with the ISS, during which his team left behind an American flag to be retrieved by the next group of astronauts launched from U.S. soil.Now, nearly 10 years later, he'll capture the flag he left behind.Contributing: Emre Kelly, Florida Today",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-07-17T00:00:00,Mark OlaldeUSA TODAY,"Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I’m Mark Olalde.Where to even begin in a week that saw court battles over methane and water, oil companies floundering and broken links in the food chain? How about we begin with $2 trillion?That's the amount former Vice President Joe Biden proposes spending to create a greener economy while totally transitioning to clean energy by 2035, USA TODAY reports. That's, of course, not the whole story, and he has been continuously dinged during the primary for not having a plan as thorough as those from Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others. But, when compared to the Republican platform's plans to tackle climate change (they don't exist), it stands out.At the same time, President Donald Trump this week announced a sweeping rollback of the National Environmental Policy Act, which is a keystone environmental regulation, the AP reports. Some environment reporters pointed out that squeezing the law will be necessary to aid renewable energy construction, too, although it's unclear to what extent that factored into the decision.Here's some other important reporting....MUST-READ STORIESDown goes Frazier. If you catch me at a roulette table, my chips will likely be hanging out on the black felt. But my advice on Big Oil? Don't bet on black. Another major petroleum company filed for bankruptcy this week, as they try to make $5 billion in debt disappear. The company, California Resources Corp., would like you to believe their woes are a result of the recent COVID-19-fueled demand downturn. That's simply not true, and I laid all that out in an investigation earlier this year, before the pandemic was a major concern in the U.S. Janet Wilson and I have the scoop on this latest fossil fuel bankruptcy and what it means for an industry that's recently been hammered.The transition. I've harped on it before, but it's worth another mention. The divestment movement — activists pushing university endowments and public pension funds to invest their dollars far from fossil fuels — is still somewhat scoffed at by the financial sector. But, the Wall Street Journal reports, that might be changing as billions of dollars are being withheld via these movements. At the same time, California recently plugged in the country's largest battery storage system, Bloomberg reports, giving a preview of a future where mega-batteries support widespread renewable generation.Water agencies step into the ring. Staying in the Golden State, two heavyweights of the water world — the Imperial Irrigation District and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California — are duking it out for a seat at the Colorado River negotiating table. A fight over political control of the overdrawn waterway also raises concerns about what this means for the ever-shrinking Salton Sea. I've got the details for you here. POLITICAL CLIMATEFrack off. Several indigenous and environmental groups have launched a new lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management, E&E writes, to halt the controversial decision to sell leases for oil and gas development near Chaco Canyon National Historical Park.The war on your roof. A secretive nonprofit called the New England Ratepayers Association in April filed a petition to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that solar advocates said could've destroyed net-metering and the incentive to install rooftop solar. The petitioners argued that other ratepayers were subsidizing rich solar users, but the feds struck them down, at least temporarily. For The Desert Sun, I've got the details of the ongoing solar wars.Halting trees at the border. ""America needs millions of new trees each year for forests damaged by natural catastrophes, thinned by logging and developed to protect watersheds,"" Politico reports. But, the people who accept the seasonal jobs planting those millions of trees? Well, they're mostly visa-holders from Mexico and South America, and the Trump administration's aggressive anti-immigration policies have locked them out of the country. Not enough Americans are even accepting these jobs, and the forest's worth of trees might not be planted this year.WHAT WE EATBroken link in the food chain. InsideClimate News reports that since COVID-19 ripped through populations around the globe, ""the world's food system has undergone a stress test—and largely failed it."" The pandemic has laid bare the fact that there is no global strategy to support food chains. If we think a global economic slowdown has been difficult to manage, just imagine how widespread climate change's impacts will be. The story found that — between poverty, famine, environmental woes and the pandemic — the number of people without adequate food is approaching 1 billion, and the current worldwide shakeup must be used to reassess food supply.Must be something in the water. Colorado's Water Quality Control Commission on Tuesday unanimously voted to address the amount of PFAS, a carcinogenic class of chemicals, finding its way into waters. Colorado Public Radio has the story of the push to address these ""forever chemicals"" around Colorado Springs.AND ANOTHER THINGBirding, nude swimming and Elon Musk. Thanks for joining me for another week of my environmental ramblings. This time, I'd like to leave you with something completely different. A few weeks ago, a fire raged through a small community in Southern California, just east of the Salton Sea. While covering it, The Desert Sun's breaking news reporters and photographers met a fascinating man named Barnacle Snug Luffy, and I headed down to learn more about the 6-acre birding oasis he and his wife Satya had built over the years. Some of Southern California's most well-known birders went there, but very few others knew it existed. Join me for a tale about a fascinating couple who carved out their own, one-of-a-kind slice of the environment.Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm.

",2020-06-06T00:00:00,Jefferson GrahamUSA TODAY,"With many of us trying to find new ways to make working at home palatable during a pandemic, you've got to love Jeremiah Owyang's solution. Owyang, an independent tech analyst, needed space to call his own, and found a great alternative to sky-high Silicon Valley rentals. He bought a small 22-foot Airstream RV, parked it in his backyard, and souped it up for video calls. Owyang surveyed the local real estate market, and found that rentals were charging at least $2,000 monthly. Instead, he got a 20-year-loan at $370 monthly for a $50,000 Airstream ""Sport"" trailer.  ""I own it. I can claim it as a business deduction and re-sell it at some point in the future,"" Owyang says.. As he said this week on Twitter: ""I used to fly to conferences, now, I just walk to the backyard.""He describes the ""Tiny Airstream Studio"" as ""29 steps from the house,"" and ""a quiet place to work."" It's also a production studio for the pandemic age, making lemonade from lemons for someone who needed to alter the way he works.""Because I make money from speaking at conferences, I needed to show people I have the setup,"" he says. ""Yes, I have a studio in my backyard; how can I help you?""As he posted on Medium, ""Now, like most, my primary stage is from my own home, umm err backyard. To ensure my message is best communicated to the market, having decent audio and visual setup is critical during this socially isolating pandemic.""So in his backyard, he flips on the ring lights, turns on his Sony A6400 camera, attaches his Movo lavalier microphone to his shirt lapel, cranks open a video conference program, and he's ready to interview executives and give speeches.Beyond the camera, lav mic, Logitech webcam and Samsung 30-inch monitor, ""the most important"" tech tool in the trailer is his 1-gigabyte Comcast internet signal.""I have massive speed,"" he says. (He also puts the internet through an Orbi Mesh Wireless Router by Netgear.) ""The setup is like a little executive suite.""So much so that when people see him on their video program, they think ""it's fake,"" and that he's inserted a background image. Finally, a client asked him point blank if he was in a trailer.""I was worried he would think he didn't pay us enough money,"" but that didn't happen.""There are different cultural reactions to being in a trailer,"" he says. Luckily, most people responded with envy, not disdain. Recently, he has picked up gigs doing a keynote speech from the Airstream, about innovation culture for Hewlett-Packard EnterpriseMeanwhile, don't look for Owyang to be cruising this summer on the open road. It's a permanent fixture in the backyard.""We don’t take it out, it’s a dedicated office,"" he says. Putting Airstreams to novel uses isn't unique. Zappos founder Tony Hsieh bought a bunch of them for workers, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a village of them in the desert. When all is said and done, ""this is the future,"" Owyang says. ""People are going to need dedicated, quiet places to work,"" and will need to seek out alternatives. That could include moving from a high-density, high rent location like San Francisco to lower cost out of state, and switching from a one bedroom apartment to a two or three bedroom, or getting a separate unit for a backyard like a Tuffshed or Airstream. For himself, ""I'm commuting to work. It just happens to be 29 steps away from my house.""In other tech news this weekCurrent and former Facebook employees blasted CEO Mark Zuckerberg for his stance on not labeling President Donald Trump's posts. Meanwhile, Snapchat said it would stop promoting Trump's posts. CES: The show will go on. Despite all those convention cancellations and the COVID threat that hasn't gone away, the CES, which draws massive crowds (over 175,000 in 2020) will go on next year, organizers said, with more cleaning of booth areas and wider aisles. Zoom: No end-to-end encryption for free users so company can work with law enforcement. Meanwhile, in its earnings announcement this week, Zoom showed how a pandemic can help a small company, as it went from 10 million users in the year ago quarter to 300 million, and revenue jumped to $328.2 million from $122 million.  This week's Talking Tech podcastsPlease ditch FaceID on next iPhoneOkay, you like FaceID even if I don'tReal's latest: facial recognition for videosHow to network in a pandemicWatch what you say on NextDoor: it's not privateFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter",tesla,usatoday,,

""I am running for president of the United States.""So far, however, there is no evidence West has a campaign organization, nor is there any indication he has filed papers with the Federal Election Commission just four months before the Nov. 3 election.The filing deadlines for independent presidential candidates in many states have either passed or are coming up soon. Qualifying deadlines have passed in Texas, North Carolina, New York, Maine, New Mexico and Indiana. The last deadlines are in early September, just two months away, and candidates have to get thousands of people to sign petitions in each state in order to get on a ballot.West would have to clear procedural hurdles to get on the ballot on any state, and with little or no organization. If he makes the ballot in only a few states – still a big if – he could conceivably take black votes away from Democrat Joe Biden to the benefit of President Donald Trump.West, who has often injected himself into the political arena, has said both nice and critical things about Trump.In October 2018, West attended an Oval Office meeting with Trump for a group discussion of criminal justice reform.It turned into one of the most unusual events in White House history.In an extended riff that ranged from racism and tax breaks to the need for more art and mental health programs, West at one point told reporters: “You are tasting a fine wine. ... It has complex notes to it.”More:Kanye West goes on 10-minute soliloquy, references Superman cape and swears during White House visitMore:Here's every word of Kanye West's bizarre meeting with President TrumpAs for the president, West said: ""Trump is on his hero’s journey right now. And he might not have expected to have a crazy m----- f----- like Kanye West run up and support, but best believe we are going to make America great.""West's latest claim that he may challenge Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden did draw some support on social media.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who supported Andrew Yang during the Democratic primaries, tweeted at Kanye that ""you have my full support!"" The singer's spouse, Kim Kardashian West, re-tweeted her husband's declaration along the with the image of an American flag.West's candidacy, if it comes to pass, could conceivably help Trump in his re-election bid, analysts said. Pollster Frank Luntz said that West could be a threat to take votes, particularly African American votes, from presumptive Democratic nominee Biden – but only if West gets on enough state ballots.""I find it impossible to believe that he will be in this race more than a month or two,"" Luntz said. ""And everyone energized because of Kanye will end up back with Biden.”Luntz noted that, back in 2000, another ""famous guy"" – Ralph Nader – appeared to take just enough away votes from Al Gore to enable George W. Bush to squeeze to victory in Florida (after a still-disputed recount).""I don’t find Kanye serious,"" Luntz said, ""but I find his potential electoral impact serious if he still on the ballot in November.""Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, said polling on Kanye would be required to see ""whether anybody takes him seriously"" as a legitimate candidate.""But how does he get on state ballots?"" Rothenberg said. ""How does he put together a campaign? What are his motives – is he trying to help Trump in attracting certain voters?""Rachel Bitecofer, election forecaster and senior fellow at the Niskanen Center, said a serious West candidacy would ""not be an insignificant threat"" to the Biden campaign. ""Celebrity is a major asset,"" she said, adding that even if West doesn't appear on ballots, he has the money and fame to mount a legitimate write-in campaign.""Then you don't need ballot access. He's got his own fortune, his wife's fortunate and obviously support from Elon Musk, who's a multi-billionaire,"" she said.Bitecofer said young voters, particularly under 24 years old, would be the most likely drawn to the ""celebrity effect"" and vote for West. That could include young Black voters. Bitecofer said the Trump campaign would have ""an incentive"" to promote West's candidacy as a write-in to peel off potential votes from Biden.""Let's say he was serious and he put time, effort and money into this effort then it could potentially siphon off votes from Biden,"" she said, and perhaps some votes from Trump as well. ""It really would be dependent on that amount of effort. If it's just a joke then obviously it's not going to have that much of an effect.""If I was on the Biden campaign today and this came across last night, I would definitely see it as a serious threat and one that I would want to avoid,"" she said.",tesla,usatoday,,

The sharp rebuke came after the leaders met with company executives Tuesday and amid escalating calls for reform at Facebook. It also set the stage for further conflict in the advertising boycott led by civil rights groups.

By reaching out on the phone. “I randomly dial people,” says Pham, the co-founder of tech incubator Science Inc., who looks to networking to find the next great company to invest in and to attract investors for the companies he works with. “I’m taking more of an effort to say, 'Hi' and catch up.” Without conferences, he can’t randomly run into people and do just that. This year alone, major tech conferences like the Mobile World Congress, Facebook and Google developer meetings, the Code conference and the National Association of Broadcasters meetings were either postponed or canceled. Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference, which normally meets in the first week of June, shifted to a digital-only format and will be seen online on June 22. How to stage a good video meeting?

""Online, you establish the connection immediately.""To network, he recommends finding out when the next public business meeting or happy hour is presented online and request attendance. That will get you in closer to raise your hand and get heard. It will also put you into contact with other like-minded individuals who can become potential contacts. How do you find them? Follow the people you're interested and odds are, they'll mention the meeting in their posts. Additionally, many are listed on Facebook and other social platforms. Do your researchRebecca Leder, a manager at Salesforce and author of an upcoming book on networking called ""The Knock Method,"" says networkers should scour LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter profiles and Google the subject as well before reaching out.  ""You have a lot of tools at your fingertips to know about someone,"" she says. ""You can also find out about mutual contacts and interests, which is an ice breaker.""Working remotely can be a tech challenge:Here are some tipsFrom Apple to Zoom:How to stay connected with your friends with video chatsWork your social networkIt’s simple logic. Who isn’t on Twitter? Who doesn’t want to hear back from people after they post? Engage with them, suggests Raj Nijjer, a vice-president with e-commerce platform Yotpo. “Twitter is the best-kept secret in networking,” he says. Most people think of LinkedIn first, he says, but on Twitter, beyond the political fighting, “people are more themselves and it’s a great place to meet them,” provided it’s in areas of mutual interest, which for Nijjer is marketing. How to reach people who seem out of reach? You’re not going to get to Tesla chief Elon Musk or Apple CEO Tim Cook, but down the line, others who work at the company, if they’re posting regularly, are probably willing to engage,” says Nijjer. “Otherwise they’re speaking in a vacuum.”What about LinkedIn?  Leder prefers LinkedIn. “But it depends on the industry,” she says. “Marketing is more vocal on Twitter, but finance might be better for LinkedIn.”For mastering LinkedIn, she suggests having an updated profile with a current description, a photo “that looks inviting,” and putting out posts often. Like Facebook and Twitter, LinkedIn also lets you throw out your thoughts, offer links to articles, show your latest YouTube video or photograph. The beauty of LinkedIn, says Owyang, is not just the connection, but it shows the world who you're connected to as well, which can boost your profile. Jay Grammond, a Princeton, Minnesota-based photographer, suggests going even further and getting involved in specialty groups on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. ""Find groups that focus on your area of interest/expertise and engage in positive conversations with the people in those groups,"" he says. ""Share your knowledge, and learn from others. Over time, you will likely see that networks will develop.Get to bloggingBoth Leder and Owyang are big believers in blogging as a sales tool. ""I post content that attracts people,"" says Owyang. ""I don't want to chase them. A unique video, thoughtful analysis, something that we can discuss."" He has multiple websites, but he always posts to Medium because the website, which is popular with tech insiders, will let you republish your blog post directly there. And because the site is popular, the Medium link carries more weight with Google or SEO, he says, surfacing it for more people online. Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter and LinkedIn",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-06-03T00:00:00,Glenn Harlan Reynolds,"Though the news is filled with stories of riots and a pandemic, the most transformative things going on at present are in a totally different sphere. One of those things is pretty obvious, the other less so.The obvious transformation involves SpaceX’s successful launch of a human crew into orbit, the first such launch involving an American spacecraft in nearly a decade, and the first such launch ever by a commercial spacecraft.This is huge, but in a sense, nothing new: We were launching people into orbit over 50 years ago, after all. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule is bigger and fancier than a Gemini, but the mission profile is not all that different. And of course, our last mission to orbit, on board a space shuttle, was basically old hat itself.SpaceX births new eraBut SpaceX is doing it for much less, and that’s revolutionary. To get a kilogram into orbit on the space shuttle costs $54,500. To do the same thing with SpaceX’s newest rocket, the Falcon 9, costs $2,720.  That’s basically a twenty-fold reduction in cost.Lots of things that are too expensive to do at $54,500 become doable at $2,720. And SpaceX isn’t standing still. Its Starship reusable rocket, under development now, is to cost a mere $2 million per launch, and Elon Musk says its cost per kilogram to orbit will be at least 10 times lower than the Falcon 9. There are a lot more things that become doable at $272 per kilogram. At those prices, things like space tourism, space hotels, lunar mines and asteroid mining become feasible. As Robert Heinlein once said, once you get to Earth orbit, you're halfway to anywhere in the solar system.Editorial Board:SpaceX, launching to space station, rockets to new age of entrepreneurial orbital flightWhich brings me to the second, less obvious transformation of this spring: President Donald Trump’s opening outer space for business. ""The executive order, “Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources,” is meant to create a new industry: the extraction and processing of resources from the moon and asteroids toward the settlement of the solar system,"" as I wrote in April. There’s a lot of wealth in space as I wrote back in 2013, ""A 79-foot-wide M-type (metallic) asteroid could hold 33,000 tons of extractable metals, including $50 million in platinum alone. A 23-foot-diameter C-type (carbonaceous) asteroid can hold 24,000 gallons of water, useful for generating fuel and oxygen. Larger asteroids could be worth as much as the GDP of a superpower. Asteroid 1986 DA is a metallic asteroid made up of iron, nickel, gold and platinum. Estimates of its value range between $6 and $7 trillion. Something that size won't be retrieved anytime soon, but the figure gives some idea of just how much wealth is out there.""Space for businessPeople have been talking about asteroid mining for awhile and even started companies with that in mind, but they’ve been slowed down by two problems: The expense of getting into outer space, and the legal uncertainties around extracting lunar and asteroid resources. Musk is addressing the expense; Trump is addressing the legal uncertainty.The executive order makes clear that America rejects the failed 1979 Moon Treaty — which the United States never joined, and which banned private property rights in space — and that it will recognize and defend the rights of its citizens in developing space resources.  Martha McSally:The COVID-19 pandemic is misery, but we'll come out stronger in the endIn doing so, it’s pretty bipartisan: In 2015, President Barck Obama signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which provides that “a U.S. citizen engaged in the commercial recovery of an asteroid resource or a space resource ... shall be entitled to ... possess, own, transport, use, and sell the asteroid resource or space resource obtained in accordance with applicable law, including the international obligations of the United States.”Trump’s order ensures that international obligations will be supportive and not destructive of such efforts.Rather than the Moon Treaty, the administration is working on a new set of agreements with other spacefaring nations, known as the Artemis Accords, in which participants will agree to respect each others’ rights in outer space. There’s already interest from other nations, though the Russians, whose space-launch business has collapsed in the face of competition from SpaceX, aren’t happy.At any rate, it may well be that future historians will remember 2020 much more for being the second beginning of a wave of human expansion into space, than for the grubby earthbound problems that occupy the news on a daily basis. I certainly hope so.Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of ""The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,"" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors. ",tesla,usatoday,,

And with babies out there called X Æ A-Xii, North West and Apple, there's apparently no limit to parents' creativity when it comes to names.One place parents are drawing inspiration is how the names are spelled.According to Names.org, a popular database, plenty of parents are opting to name their babies palindromes. To dust off your memory  from English class, a palindrome is a word spelled the same backward as forward. (Think Hannah, Anna and Bob.)And that's not the only way parents are naming their babies.Remember when Sonny Sandoval named his daughter Nevaeh in 2000? Many scratched their heads, as the rock star explained on MTV that the unconventional name was ""heaven"" spelled backward.Turns out, the name's caught on. According to Names.org, Nevaeh is the third most popular name that is spelled backward as a different name. These kinds of names — like Leon and Noel, Aidan and Nadia and Ira and Ari — can be suitable for twins or siblings, according to the site.Most popular baby names of 2019 (so far) are surprisingly differentHere are Names.org's 10 most popular palindrome names, according to Social Security Administration data since 1890. The number next to each name indicates the number of babies with that official name since 1890.

",2020-06-28T00:00:00,Jon SpencerMansfield News Journal,"Sean Swarner went to great lengths — and greater heights — to practice social distancing even before it became a thing.There was no mass gathering waiting for him when he reached the top of Mount Everest in 2002. Or when he scaled the highest peak on the other six continents to complete the Seven Summits. Or when he trekked to the South Pole in 2015 and the North Pole in 2017.The Ohio native literally stood alone in becoming the first cancer survivor to climb Everest as well as the only person to complete the Explorers Grand Slam — reaching the Seven Summits and both Poles — and finish the Ironman Triathlon, the almost inhuman three-pronged race of swimming, biking and running that he tackled in 2008 at age 34.He did it all after surviving two cases of cancer as a teenager and being left with only one functioning lung.But, hey, he's always had a healthy sense of humor.""I have no idea why they call it the Explorers Grand Slam,"" he said recently about being one of only 69 adventurers to accomplish that goal. ""To me it sounds like a Denny's breakfast platter.""You've heard about laughter being the best medicine? Swarner, as a teenager, needed it in large doses.Nothing is more devastating than finding out, at 13, you've got Stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma and have three months to live. You survive that only to learn, at 16, you have an unrelated form of cancer called Askin's Sarcoma and are given two weeks to live.He was listed in the medical journals as the only person to ever have both forms of deadly cancer. That's the kind of distancing from people no one seeks.But Swarner beat incredible odds both times and would continue to do so with his inspiring feats of physical and spiritual strength.Each time he completed a leg of the Grand Slam he carried a flag dedicated to everyone impacted in some way by cancer. Inscribed on the rainbow-colored flag he took to the North Pole were 1,960 names and the word HOPE.""It's amazing how the body adjusts,"" he said. ""I think I have one big, bulldog lung that over the years I've trained to get stronger and stronger. It's more psychological than anything else.""For someone so adverse to sitting still and staying put, COVID-19 has probably been every bit as nerve-wracking as walking precariously across aluminum ladders, sometimes three of them fastened together, over bottomless crevasses on his ascent of Everest — all 29,029 feet.This health crisis has made him stir crazy.""Last year I put in about 250,000 miles on American Airlines traveling around, making (motivational) presentations,"" Swarner said when reached at his home in Castle Rock, Colorado, ""and this is the longest I've been home in 15 years. So I'm jumping out of my skin to go somewhere and just travel.""Still climbingWhen it's safer to fly, he's looking at taking a group, through Swarner Expeditions, to Everest base camp, possibly next spring. The camp sits at 17,600 feet on the mountain and takes two weeks to reach.""I would be using that trip as a vehicle to help people overcome their fears and gain their confidence back,"" the 45-year-old Swarner said. ""It's kind of like an immersive experience to empower people.""Swarner estimates he's been to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa at 19,341 feet, 18 or 19 times. He tries to take a small group up every year and offers a free trip to a cancer survivor. That survivor, in turn, is responsible for using the climb as a fund-raiser to send another survivor the following year.""It's kind of paying it forward and keeping it in the cancer community,"" Swarner said. ""We actually raised enough money to take three survivors this year and would have left (this) week. All three said they want to go next year.""At this point, Swarner could probably scale Kilimanjaro blindfolded.""I don't know about that,"" he said, laughing, ""but they did adopt me into the Chaga Tribe, a local (Tanzanian) tribe at the base of the mountain. They gave me a name in Swahili.""It's Mzungu kichaa.""Loosely translated,"" Swarner said, ""it means crazy white man.""Sounds about right.June 19 was the 13th anniversary of Swarner's ascent of Alaska's Mount Denali, also known as McKinley, which completed his climb of the Seven Summits in a six-year span.Eight years would pass before he skied to the South Pole and then three years ago, in April, he made it to the North Pole. That latter adventure — a seven-day, 80-mile journey over floating ice in which his party braved minus-70 wind chills, pulled 150-pound sleds, risked frostbite and kept a wary eye on polar bears — was captured in a one-hour documentary called ""True North: The Sean Swarner Story."" It  can be streamed at Amazon.com.""Both (poles) are unique and have different obstacles to overcome,"" Swarner said, ""but the North Pole, hands down, is much more dangerous.""Opinion: College football's demise is America's demise  Anthony Lynn reveals he had COVID-19 in opening scene of 'Hard Knocks'  Cowboys creating mini-bubble for training camp  MLS is Back winners, losers: Timbers triumph, Galaxy is dreadful  PHOTOS: 2020 NFL training campsOf the 15 people who set out for the North Pole, several had to be evacuated for frostbite or exhaustion, including Swarner’s team doctor.And for those who made it, the only way they knew they arrived at the earth's true north (90 degrees north latitude) was by GPS. There's no land mass, no distinguishing features, just polar ice. And that ice is constantly shifting.""If you look at the world as a glass of ice water, the northern polar ice cap is like the ice cubes floating on the water,"" Swarner said. ""You have these arctic currents flowing underneath. One night we set up camp and literally floated 2 miles backwards. It's insane.""In the middle of the night, you could hear the ice cracking all around you.""Marriage Pole-posalIt's easy for Swarner to romanticize that sometimes-harrowing experience, especially since he proposed to his girlfriend, Julissa Perez, on his satellite phone from the North Pole.""I go, 'Hey, when I get home, let's go someplace warm, so I can thaw out,'"" Swarner recounted. ""My brain ... you know how fast your brain thinks. I said, 'Let's get married.' There was this long pause and I'm thinking, oh, crap, did we get disconnected? Is she thinking about this? What's going on? Then she said yes.""It gets better.""Later I called her and I told her out of respect for her family and culture (Julissa is from Puerto Rico), don't tell anybody,"" Swarner said. ""I want to ask your parents for permission. She said, 'Well, everybody already knows.'""She went on to tell me that when I called from the North Pole, she knew I was going to make it that day. So when I called she had me on speaker phone and her whole family was there.""They met in 2011 when Swarner was giving a presentation in San Juan. Julissa was in the front row and he had to keep telling himself during his address to stop staring. They were sitting at separate tables afterward, neither making a move, when he found out from her friend that Julissa wanted to meet him as much as he wanted to meet her.They got married a year ago February.""I've been told,"" he joked about giving up bachelorhood, ""that it was more difficult than climbing Everest.""Marriage doesn't mean Swarner is going to settle down. Now that he's also a certified performance coach as well as a motivational speaker, author (his book ""Keep Climbing"" was on the New York Times bestseller list), and founder of the nonprofit organization, The Cancer Climber Association, he plans to launch ""The Summit Challenge"" at SeanSwarner.com on July 1.He will be giving clients a series of seven challenges, each to be completed in three weeks. ""The goal is to really impact their lives,"" he said. ""We can stay in a state of suffering from pain or grief or we can choose to change into a state of joy and happiness.""New goals to reachSwarner, who was back home in Mansfield, Ohio last year to receive the Distinguished W Alumni Award from the Willard City Schools, also has two new extreme adventures on his radar.Next year he'd like to run a marathon on each of the seven continents in seven days. That's 26.2 miles a day. ""You get off the plane, you run, you eat, you get back on the plane, you fall asleep, you wake up, you run, you eat, you get back on the plane, you sleep ... repeat, repeat, repeat,"" he said of the whirlwind pace he would keep.Why couldn't he? He spent only seven months training to climb Everest and just five months preparing for the Ironman, against the advice from experts. And unlike most Seven Summitters, he started with Everest instead of finishing with the highest and hardest peak.He's not wired like you or me. Or anybody.As for the other goal on Swarner's wish list, that would truly test his motto: Redefining Impossible.""I'd love to get in touch with Elon Musk or Richard Branson,"" he said, ""and take a ride into space.""Makes perfect sense.

",2020-06-19T00:00:00,Emre KellyFlorida Today,"If an upstart company's visions come to fruition, adventurous tourists of the future will ascend some 100,000 feet to the stratosphere under a high-altitude ballon and gaze at stunning views of Earth below them – all without the use of a towering rocket.Space Perspective on Thursday said the company is poised to begin testing its Spaceship Neptune, a 650-foot vehicle that includes a balloon and tethered capsule, sometime next year, reported Florida Today, a USA TODAY Network member. The launch site: Kennedy Space Center's former Shuttle Landing Facility, which the company has officially leased from Space Florida, the state's spaceport authority.After liftoff, the hydrogen-filled balloon will carry a pilot and eight passengers on a 12 mph, two-hour ascent to about 19 miles above Earth, or nearly three times as high as most airliners. There, the group will spend another two hours taking in the views, capturing photos, and socializing.Those itching to share the experience on social media need not worry – internet access will be provided in the capsule, too.Though there is no clear delineation, space is widely agreed to begin at either 50 miles above sea level for NASA or 62 miles for some other organizations. The latter is known as the Karman Line.After a two-hour descent, the capsule will splash down in either the Atlantic Ocean during winter or Gulf of Mexico in the summer. All in all, the trip should take about six hours before recovery via boat.Founders and co-CEOs Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum, who are married, told reporters Thursday that tickets could initially cost around $125,000 with the goal of increasing accessibility as costs go down.""Absolutely we want to be bringing that down over time,"" Poynter said. ""We want to be able to get the price down so increasing numbers of people can go. That's why we're doing this.""By comparison, other space tourism companies such as Virgin Galactic have proposed minimum ticket prices of around $250,000, though the company could charge more later on. Its model, however, focuses on using a rocket-powered spaceplane that can take tourists to roughly 50 miles in altitude.And yet others like SpaceX, which uses comparatively massive Falcon 9 rockets and Crew Dragon capsules, plans on flying tourists to low-Earth orbit – at least 250 miles – at a cost that pushes into the millions.""Current and future leaders, artists, a whole variety of people – that is really what this is all about,"" Taber said on using the experience to improve life back on Earth.

Sign up hereDean, Jolene and their children – 15-year-old Jaylin and 12-year-old Ridge – recently made the voyage to Florida to watch Dean's brother Doug Hurley's launch in the Crew Dragon capsule atop the Falcon 9 rocket, along with fellow astronaut Bob Behnken. They arrived at the ISS 19 hours after the launch. When the rocket took off at 3:22 p.m. May 30 at the Kennedy Space Center's pad 39A, it marked the first time in nearly 10 years that American astronauts launched to space from American soil. It also marked the United States' entrance into commercial space flight.This history is not lost on Dean, who pumped his fists in the air as the rocket's vibrations rumbled through the bleachers at the Banana Creek Launch Viewing Area in Florida. ""At some point, probably, my brother’s name will be in books that the kids will learn about,"" he said.SpaceX:How Elon Musk took SpaceX from an idea to the cusp of making historySpace launch:For Elon Musk, a space taxi is just the first step for life on MarsBehnken and Hurley will spend one to four months on board, depending on the demonstration mission's needs. Dean and his family are communicating sporadically with Doug through email, and tracking his whereabouts and activity through NASA's website. They have stories of the historic launch – and a photo with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk – to share with friends and family members before they're reunited with Doug. Dean thinks that won't be until hunting season.""That’s the guy that sits across from Thanksgiving dinner every year,"" Jolene said. Watching the launchDean, Jolene and their children arrived in Florida on May 24, ahead of the initial May 27 launch date. The next day, they took a tour of the Kennedy Space Center, where they were able to see the rocket that would send Doug to space.  About 15 feet away, behind a blue line, was Doug, his wife, Karen, and son, Jack. They had been in quarantine for about a month and couldn't come close to anyone prior to the launch. But the trio was able to say their goodbyes across the line, and even gather for a socially distanced selfie. The May 27 launch was scrubbed due to inclement weather, something the Hurley family has become accustomed to. In 2009, Doug's first space shuttle mission was scrubbed five times – three for weather-related concerns – before it finally launched.So, when it was halted on May 27, Dean and Jolene canceled return flights home, extended arrangements with their jobs in the Southern Tier and and secured a few more days' stay at their Airbnb.""There's no way we're going to leave,"" Dean said. Falcon 9 has to launch at exactly the specified time for ISS missions. As the space station slingshots around Earth at 17,000 mph some 250 miles in orbit, the rocket has to help the capsule achieve a precise intercept trajectory. A delay would mean it couldn't catch up.On May 30, the day of the second attempt at the launch, the Hurley family met at the Kennedy Space Center's education center around 12:30 p.m. They arrived early to see the space shuttle Atlantis, which launched from the same pad in 2011. Hurley piloted that last shuttle mission.They headed back to a holding room, where videos of Doug and Bob were projected on a large board. Jolene periodically pulled up NASA TV, watching as her nephew, Jack, said goodbye to his father for the second time. They ate lunch and caught a bus to the Banana Creek Launch Viewing Area with about a half hour to spare before the 3:22 launch.Only about 30 people were shuttled over to the area designated for family, significantly smaller than the 500 or so that would typically attend a launch if there wasn't a pandemic. ""This was actually quite quick and easy and just so much more at ease,"" Jolene said. ""There wasn’t the chaos surrounding everything, because of COVID.""Like the first launch attempt, weather threatened to halt operations but cleared up in time. ""Ten minutes before the launch, I knew it was going to happen,"" Dean said. Doug's 15 or so family members and friends – some from childhood and his time in the military – sat on bleachers. Available bathrooms reminded Jolene of those at Arnold Park in Vestal. The Banana Creek Launch Viewing Area looked east, some 3 miles from the Falcon 9. A body of water and stretch of land separated the family from launch pad, but didn't block the sights or sounds of the fiery rocket, which rumbled the bleachers. ""You actually feel the vibration through your body,"" Dean said.But before you hear and feel the rocket launch – you see it. ""You see the puff of smoke when it starts coming up and it’s not as loud as you think until it gets up,"" Dean said. ""Then you start feeling the energy of the rocket, you actually feel the vibration through your body.""Tears welled in Dean's eyes as he pumped his fists. Jolene cried. ""Everyone was crying,"" she said.Dean was overwhelmed, unable to put the feeling to words.""Your body is just exploding on the inside with just so much happiness and joy and pride,"" he said. At home, friends and loved ones, including Jolene's dad, were on pins and needles. After all, it was the first time SpaceX had launched a manned rocket.""There’s so much danger involved,"" Jolene said. ""You’re on a million-pound rocket with a lot of fuel and it’s the first time, and you don’t know what’s going to happen. So, you know, every time it got to a certain stage and then they released the Falcon 9, (you breathe) a sigh of relief.

",2020-06-01T00:00:00,Emre KellyFlorida Today,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:004:59ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenBREVARD COUNTY, Fla. – Safely and ahead of schedule, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley docked with the International Space Station on Sunday, a crucial milestone in SpaceX's first mission to fly humans to orbit.Their 27-foot Crew Dragon capsule, launched from Kennedy Space Center at 3:22 p.m. EDT Saturday, made contact with the orbiting outpost at 10:16 a.m. – a timeline just shy of the predicted 19-hour trek. Docking was completed 14 minutes later with ""hard capture,"" or an airtight seal between the ISS and Crew Dragon.""It's been a real honor to be a small part of this nine-year endeavor since a United States spaceship has docked with the International Space Station,"" mission commander Hurley said. ""This is an incredible time to be at NASA. Three new vehicles to be flown, continuing missions to low-Earth orbit, and then to the moon and Mars.""Elon Musk:How he took SpaceX from an idea to the cusp of making historyAstronaut Chris Cassidy, already on board the ISS after launching on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, welcomed the veteran astronauts by ringing a bell in the station's Unity module. The Navy tradition is used to welcome the arrival of new crew members.By 1:02 p.m., the pressure between Crew Dragon and the ISS had been equalized, allowing the astronauts to open the hatch and officially join Cassidy and cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.""We're just really glad to be on this magnificent complex,"" Hurley said during a post-arrival news conference. ""This is just one effort that we can show for the ages in this dark time that we've had over the past several months.""Asked during the conference what the 19-hour flight was like, Behnken said Falcon 9 liftoff's was surprisingly smooth. After separation, he said Crew Dragon was more ""alive"" than the comparatively massive space shuttle orbiter he last flew in 2010.""We were definitely driving and riding a dragon all the way up,"" Behnken said. ""It was not quite the smooth ride the space shuttle was. A little bit more 'alive' is the best way I would describe it.""For Hurley, the docking is familiar. In 2011, he was on the final space shuttle mission's rendezvous with the ISS, during which his team left behind an American flag to be retrieved by the next group of astronauts launched from U.S. soil.Now, nearly 10 years later, he'll capture the flag he left behind.The docking marks something of a halfway point for SpaceX. After a one-to-four-month stay on the station, Behnken and Hurley will reenter the capsule for departure and a splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean. If successful, it will pave the way for SpaceX to continue flying astronauts for NASA and other agencies. It has even secured interest from civilians like actor Tom Cruise for flights to low-Earth orbit.Police cars burn as violence mars National Day of Protest:George Floyd protests live updatesSaturday's liftoff from Pad 39A on a Falcon 9 rocket returned the U.S. to crewed spaceflight, which ended in July 2011 with the final flight of the space shuttle. Under multibillion-dollar contracts doled out by NASA, SpaceX and Boeing were selected in 2014 to build new commercial spacecraft and return astronauts to the station.With its docking, Crew Dragon became the fifth vehicle now attached to the ISS. Also there are two Russian Progress cargo craft, a Russian Soyuz capsule and a Japanese HTV-9 cargo vehicle.Follow reporter Emre Kelly on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at @EmreKelly",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-06-03T00:00:00,Colman Andrews,"The restaurant trade has been particularly hard-hit by the onset of COVID-19. More than 8 million restaurant employees have been laid off or furloughed around the country. The restaurant industry as a whole is predicted to sustain $240 billion in losses by the end of 2020, according to a National Restaurant Association study of the economic impact of the coronaviruscrisis.Restaurants in many states are now at least partially open again, usually for outdoor dining only, or else with restrictions on indoor capacity. While waiting for business to resume, many establishments have managed to stay in business by making dine-out options available to their customers. There have even been fancy restaurants offering takeout and delivery during the coronavirus crisis.Nevertheless, many thousands that closed ""temporarily"" when the first lockdown orders were issued have subsequently determined that they simply won't be able to afford to reopen. In California alone, according to the California Restaurant Association, as many as 30,000 eating places might be out of business by the time the crisis abates. Restaurants are often examples of iconic businesses closed because of the coronavirus.24/7 Tempo has assembled an updated list of 50 of the most popular eating places, in some 26 states and Washington D.C., that will not be reopening. These range from family-style Chinese restaurants to slick steakhouses, from neighborhood pubs to high-profile outposts of the Wolfgang Puck and David Chang empires.In addition to the individual restaurants on this list, numerous units of such nationwide chains as P.F. Chang's, Outback Steakhouse, Denny's, Morton's the Steakhouse, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Steak 'n Shake, and TGI Fridays have shuttered for good.Some national or regional chains are closing down entirely, as well, among them Specialty's Café and Bakery, which had 50 restaurants in California, Washington, and Illinois, and Sweet Tomatoes (called Souplantation in Southern California), a 97-location salad, soup, and bakery buffet chain covering several states. Still other notable operations have filed for bankruptcy, with their futures uncertain but at least some restaurant closings probably inevitable. Among these are Le Pain Quotidien and a 49-unit Florida-based IHOP franchisee.New casualties are announced almost daily in virtually every state. 24/7 Tempo will periodically update and expand this list as the number of restaurants closing permanently continues to grow.Cheese craze:Why are there international pleas to eat more cheese?

Chef-owner Silvana Salcido Esparza cited ""zero funding and coronavirus"" as the factors involved with her decision – adding that closing the place will allow her to save her other Phoenix restaurant, Barrio Café, currently operating as a community kitchen.California: Swingers• Location: Los AngelesA 27-year-old late-night hangout on Beverly Boulevard, Swingers ended service for good in early April. What Eater described as its ""classic mid-century coffee shop vibes and...wide menu"" appealed to a broad clientele. The same proprietors' pub and restaurant The Pikey have also closed that place down, though they have plans to convert the space into a different restaurant at some future point.California: Clarke's Charcoal Broiler• Location: Mountain ViewClarke's was known for serving what its website describes as ""delicious, charcoal-broiled burgers and barbecue since 1945"" in what is now called Silicon Valley. ""Due to COVID-19 and the current extended shelter in place,"" reads a statement on the site, ""it has made it impossible for us to continue on."" The closing was effective March 31.California: Biba Restaurant•Location: SacramentoBologna-born Biba Caggiano ramped up the restaurant scene in the California capital when she opened this place 33 years ago. Caggiano, who went on to become a successful cookbook author and TV food personality, died last August, and her family was already reportedly having difficulty running the restaurant before the crisis. Early in May, they announced on Facebook that ""with the uncertainty of what the future holds, we are unable to wait out this storm.""California: Troy's Family Restaurant• Location: San DiegoTroy's, which has served the city's Clairemont neighborhood for 46 years, closed for good in late April. ""As every month goes by,"" owner Mary Likomitros told San Diego's CBS8, ""the bills just don't stop."" She said that the restaurant had applied for a Paycheck Protection Program loan through Wells Fargo bank, but never heard back from them.California: Locanda• Location: San FranciscoSpecializing in Roman-style pasta dishes, and hailed as a ""must-visit Italian restaurant"" by the San Francisco Chronicle, this upscale restaurant closed permanently in mid-March. Though it was popular, owner Craig Stoll told the Chronicle, it never made money, and the current crisis made its continued existence untenable.California: Viognier Restaurant• Location: San MateoThe restaurant at Draeger's Market in this Silicon Valley community south of San Francisco was originally scheduled to reopen on April 30, but the San Francisco Chronicle reports that a sign posted at the place states that it is now permanently closed.Colorado: 20th Street Café• Location: DenverAfter 74 years in business under three generations of the Okuno family, this neighborhood breakfast-and-lunch establishment has called it quits. The place has survived ""up-turns and crazy downturns in the economy,"" wrote current owners Rod and Karen Okuno on the restaurant website, ""but this final one proved to be insurmountable for our little corner of the world.""Colorado: The Market at Larimer Square• Location: DenverThis beloved deli, bakery, market, and espresso bar combination – it was said to have been the first espresso bar between L.A. and New York City – opened in 1983. Its closing isn't due only to the coronavirus (the proprietor had been considering retiring soon anyway), but the pandemic sped up its demise.Florida: Jackson's Prime• Location: Fort LauderdaleEarly in April, this steakhouse, operated by local restaurant veteran Jack Jackson since 2017, announced that it had closed for good due to the coronovirus's ""crippling effect"" on the economy.Georgia: The Georgia Grille• Location: AtlantaWhile she didn't specifically cite the coronavirus crisis as the reason, Georgia Grille owner Karen Hilliard announced on Facebook on April 27 that ""It is time to say goodbye."" The Southwestern-style restaurant, named in honor of artist Georgia O'Keeffe, had been in business for 30 years.Illinois: Little Bucharest Bistro• Location: ChicagoThis 50-year-old Eastern European restaurant originally planned to close down last October, but a planned sale fell through. This time, though, it's gone for good, shuttering as of April 30. ""[W]e would be lying if we were to say that COVID-19 is the only reason we are closing,"" according to a statement from the restaurant to Eater, ""but it is definitely the straw that broke the camel's back."" The location will be taken over for an upscale Mexican restaurant from Geno Bahena, a longtime veteran of Rick Bayless's definitive Chicago Mexican establishments.Illinois: Luella's Gospel Bird• Location: ChicagoA fried chicken specialist in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood, opened in 2018, Luella's has gone out of business as a result of the pandemic closing. The original location, in Lincoln Square, continues on, doing takeout and delivery, and plans to reopen when the situation stabilizes.Illinois: Toast• Locations: ChicagoNeither location of this 24-year-old breakfast-and-brunch favorite – Bucktown and Lincoln Park – will return, even when dining restrictions in the city are lifted. ""There isn't any kind of fund sitting in the bank to cover expenses,"" owner Jeanne Roeser told Chicago's Fox32. Anyway, she added, with occupancy limits, masks, and social distancing, diners wouldn't enjoy the kind of experience the restaurant had long provided.Indiana: Next Door American Eatery• Location: IndianapolisThis casual farm-to-table restaurant has closed indefinitely, though a spokesperson left open the possibility that it could reopen ""once we get through this pandemic."" Its staff has been permanently let go in the meantime. The place, which debuted in 2016, is owned by Kimball Musk, younger brother of Tesla boss and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk.Iowa: Trostel's Dish• Location: CliveOpen since 2005, this small-plates restaurant in the Des Moines metropolitan area closed temporarily in March like other Iowa establishments.

Uraiklang had died recently of cancer, but her family promised her they'd keep the place going. The impact of the coronavirus made that impossible, they said.Louisiana: Satterfield's Upper Deck Restaurant• Location: New RoadsThis popular steak and seafood restaurant on the banks of False River near Baton Rouge closed on April 30 and it recently announced that it would not be reopening. Satterfield's was established in 1996 in a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, originally home to a 1917-vintage Ford dealership, Satterfield's Motors.

The diner was struggling even before the virus hit – it was the subject of a makeover on the Food Network show ""Restaurant Impossible"" – but as Fogg explained to the Portland Press-Herald, ""We've always been able to just get by, but now we can't.""Maryland: Döner Bistro• Location: FrederickA German-inspired Biergarten and grill (whose name references the Turkish sandwich that is popular street food in Germany), this establishment, opened in 2014, announced its permanent demise in mid-April.

Owner Robert Harris is restructuring his catering arm, launching a take-out and delivery brand called Season to Go, but felt that the restaurant had to go. ""[T]his is the sad and harsh reality I and the teams I employ all had to face,"" he said in a press release.Massachusetts: Hattapon's Thai Kitchen• Location: GreenfieldThis 14-year-old Thai favorite in northern Massachusetts won't reopen even when it would be permitted. The owners had already decided to close this spring for economic reasons, but the pandemic hurried things along, and also made it impossible for them to sell food at various local festivals as they had planned.Minnesota: Vivo Kitchen• Location: Apple ValleyThis eclectic 400-seat restaurant in a Twin Cities suburb announced that its doors were permanently closed on May 24 in a statement on its Facebook page on May 16. ""We have given our absolute best to innovate and adapt to the ever-changing pandemic world we live in,"" wrote the establishment's executive director, ""[but] the reality is that the business margins...are not maintainable.Minnesota: The Egg and I Diner• Location: MinneapolisThe Egg and I had been serving breakfast dishes daily, for both breakfast and lunch, for more than 30 years. After it closed on March 17 in response to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's order, the owner decided not to reopen and to sell the property instead. He still plans to reopen his second location, in St. Paul, when possible.New Hampshire: The Joinery Restaurant• Location: NewmarketThe proprietor of this 6-year-old farm-to-table restaurant near Portsmouth decided in mid-March not to reopen even when he's allowed to. ""I didn't feel it was prudent to take on more debt"" that might be difficult to pay back, he said.New Jersey: Jake's Restaurant & Bar• Location: FlemingtonA staple in Flemington, a Hunterdon County town southwest of Newark, for almost 30 years, Jake's was a combination fine-dining restaurant and sports bar. The owners announced on April 9 that their temporary closing had become permanent.New Mexico: The Cooperage• Location: AlbuquerqueOpened in 1976, this prime rib restaurant, also noted for its salad bar, announced at the beginning of April that it had shuttered for good. The loss of wedding and catering business was a contributing factor.New York: The Chef & the Cook• Location: BaldwinsvilleThis 2-year-old establishment in the Syracuse metropolitan area became possibly the first restaurant in central New York State to announce that it would not reopen once the coronavirus shut-down ended. The owners decided in late March to pull the plug, noting that their lease was due for renewal soon anyway.Ask HR:Can my company require temperature checks?Want to quit over COVID-19?:Some things you need to knowNew York: Coogan's• Location: New York CityThis Irish pub and restaurant in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood – which styled itself ""America's #1 Runners Restaurant"" – closed its doors on March 17 for what was initially going to be a limited period of time. On April 21, however, the owners posted a statement on the Coogan's website saying ""We had hoped to open them again but sadly that is not possible.""New York: Daddy-O• Location: New York CityA Greenwich Village dive bar and restaurant, Daddy-O was a favorite hangout for New York City chefs until it closed up earlier this month. It had an upstate New York vibe, as expressed by dishes like Buffalo wings and the Rochester specialty the ""garbage plate"" (involving fried potatoes, hot dogs, baked beans, meat sauce, and other ingredients). Owner Phil Casaceli has confirmed the closing but provided no details about the restaurant's demise.New York: Lucky Strike• Location: New York CityOpened in 1989 by noted Manhattan restaurant mogul Keith McNally, this SoHo bistro initially provided takeout and delivery services when in-house dining was banned, like many other places.

McNally – whose other restaurants include the acclaimed Balthazar and Minetta Tavern – was himself hospitalized in London with COVID-19 in early April.New York: Momofuku Nishi• Location: New York CityDavid Chang, the chef-restaurateur whose Momofuku empire has been a major influence on the American food scene. He opened this establishment in 2016 with an Italian-Korean theme, recasting it with a more purely Italian menu the following year. It never took off like some of his other places, and in mid-May, his company announced on its website that ""returning to normal is not an option,"" so the place won't reopen. Chang also plans to move his popular Ssäm Bar from the East Village to South Street Seaport, where he has another restaurant location.New York: The Paris Café• Location: New York CityThe logo for this 147-year-old pub and restaurant at South Street Seaport reads ""Since 1873 - Forever.""

We had no option but to close our doors.""Ohio: Parkers Blue Ash Tavern• Location: CincinnatiA suburban Cincinnati favorite, serving steak and seafood in an upscale environment for almost 40 years, the Tavern has posted a message on its website reading in part ""Due to the uncertainty associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry, and Parkers Blue Ash Tavern in particular, it has been very difficult for us to plan a reopening.""Ohio: Spice Kitchen & Bar• Location: ClevelandCiting cancellations for its catering business as well as declining restaurant revenues, this 8-year-old establishment – named one of Cleveland Magazine's best restaurants of the year in 2019 – announced in mid-March that it was shuttering permanently. The catering company will continue to operate.Oregon: Pacific Way Bakery & Café• Location: GearhartThis 32-year-old neighborhood restaurant and bakery on the coast in northern Oregon is yet another casualty of the pandemic. Owners John and Lisa Allen had just invested in a renovation of the dining room when the crisis hit, and they said they got no response when they applied for a Paycheck Protection Program grant that might have helped them hang on. In announcing their decision to close permanently, Lisa Allen told the Seaside Signal ""We cannot financially ruin ourselves to the point where we would sell our home and live on the street.""Oregon: Clyde Common• Location: PortlandThis downtown Portland eatery is credited with having helped to animate the city's vibrant food scene when it opened more than a decade ago. The owners announced in early May that the financial effects of the pandemic had made it impossible to reopen, though they report that they might install a simpler restaurant in the same location in the future.Pennsylvania: Alexander's Italian Bistro• Location: PittsburghThe Colaizzi family has owned this restaurant in Bloomfield, Pittsburgh's Little Italy, since opening it as Alto's in 1958.

David Howard, president of Neighborhood Dining Group, which owns the restaurant, issued a statement saying in part that ""we've come to the difficult decision that McCrady's...will no longer be viable in this changed business environmentâ¦."" The group's Mexican restaurant, Minero, upstairs from McCrady's, will also close for good, though a new location is planned on nearby Johns Island.South Carolina: Yesterdays Restaurant and Tavern• Location: ColumbiaThis 43-year-old institution in the South Carolina capital's Five Points neighborhood closed in early April, expecting to possibly reopen. However, co-owner Scottie MacRae told the newspaper The State in late April that ""with heavy but grateful hearts...we've decided to hang it up for good.""Tennessee: Grove Grill• Location: MemphisThis restaurant in the Laurelwood Shopping Center would have turned 23 in October, but the owners announced in early May that it would not reopen. Chef-owner Jeffrey Dunham told Memphis Flyer that he had been counting on ""early summer business, graduation, Easter, and Mother's Day and all that to get us going."" Unfortunately, he added, ""[W]hen this hit, it just set us too far behind.""Texas: Threadgill's• Location: AustinOpened as a gas station and beer bar in 1933, this Austin institution evolved into a full-scale restaurant and leading music venue, spawning a second location in 1996.

The deal fell through, and Citizen shut downWashington: The Brooklyn Seafood, Steak & Oyster House• Location: SeattleKnown for more than a quarter of a century for its serious oyster menu as well as its meat and seafood dishes, The Brooklyn called it quits as of March 13.

Lyft does, however, hope to ""help drivers access incentive funds"" provided by someone else, although the company is not specific about who it expects to pony up.Perhaps more importantly (and more incentivizing to drivers), Lyft argues that ""the shift to EVs will create opportunities for drivers to lower costs"" (because electric vehicles don't need oil changes, for example) and to thereby ""keep more of their earnings.""The company says it's also hoping that partners such as the Environmental Defense Fund will help it to lobby ""policymakers"" to promote the transition to renewable energy-powered vehicles, with the goal of ""making electric transport the new normal by 2030.""If that happens, the biggest benefit of Lyft's proposed transition may not be Lyft itself, its drivers, or even its customers, but automakers like Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) that have taken the lead in making and selling electric cars.Rich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

",2020-01-27T00:00:00,By Adam Shell,"The first big investment wave in tech was the personal computer. Then came software, the internet, smartphones, social media and cloud computing.The next big thing is artificial intelligence, or AI, professional stock pickers say.AI is the science-fiction-like technology in which computers are programmed to think and perform the tasks ordinarily done by humans.The size of the global AI market is expected to grow to $202.6 billion by 2026, up from $20.7 billion in 2018, according to Fortune Business Insights. Funding of upstart AI companies by venture capitalists remains brisk. Last year, 956 deals valued at $13.5 billion took place through the third quarter, putting AI deal activity on pace for “another record year,” according to PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor.Should you marry your money?After the wedding, should you marry your money in a joint account? Here are 3 approaches.Apple store closed:Apple says it resolved outage that knocked out the App Store for some customersMike Lippert, manager of the Baron Opportunity fund, says AI touches more than half of the 60-plus stock holdings in his mutual fund. Those stocks are all about innovation, transformation and disruption, three traits AI has in abundance.“I won’t claim AI is in every stock in the portfolio, but it’s all over my portfolio,” Lippert tells USA TODAY.AI is creeping into every business, boosting productivity, customer service, sales, product innovation and operating efficiency. The technology is all about crunching reams of data from around the world, making sense of it and using the information to help businesses add services and operate more efficiently.“AI applications can be found in virtually every industry today, from marketing to health care to finance,” Xiaomin Mou, IFC’s senior investment officer, wrote in a report.It's paving the road to driverless cars, making decisions such as what lane to drive in and when to stop. It’s behind the software that tells salespeople which client prospect to call first.  It's the brains behind virtual assistants that can interpret voice commands and play songs or provide weather updates.“There are not a lot of companies, especially if they are growing, that are not benefiting from AI in some ways,” Lippert says.The potential danger of AI, Lippert notes, is that advances such as autonomous driving and more sophisticated machine learning will take jobs from workers.How can investors who want to get in early on the next Microsoft, Amazon, Apple or Facebook gain exposure to AI in a way that gives them the potential to profit over the long term without too much risk?Investors must take a long-term approach and not just bet on one or two companies they think will emerge as big winners in AI, says Nidhi Gupta, technology sector leader at Fidelity Investments.“Diversification is really important,” Gupta says, adding that investing in AI exposes investors to a “wide range of outcomes.”In searching for AI winners, look for three things to “unlock value,” Gupta says.1. “Rich data sets” that help create the algorithms and apps that make people's lives better.2. “Scaled computing power” as big data centers with big servers are needed.3. “AI engineering talent” to avoid brainpower “bottlenecks.”Among the AI stocks to watch:•Big AI platforms: Leading AI players include well-known, large-cap tech stocks Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). These three companies have the rich data sets, computing power and AI engineering talent that Gupta says are key to success.•Chipmakers: Nvidia’s (NVDA) powerful and fast computer chips have been found effective for use in machine learning, AI training purposes, data centers and cloud-based computing.  Another chipmaker with AI expertise is Xilinx (XLNX), says John Freeman, an analyst at Wall Street research firm CFRA.•Companies benefiting from AI: Many businesses, such as Salesforce (CRM), stand apart from their peers and competitors by integrating AI into their business, says Baron’s Lippert. Salesforce Einstein AI, for example, analyzes all types of customer data, ranging from emails to tweets, to better predict which sales leads will convert to new business, he says. Netflix (NFLX) uses AI to recommend shows and programming viewers might like. China’s online retailer Alibaba (BABA) uses AI to crunch every customer interaction to make the online sales process smoother. Electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) uses AI to enable software that is the driving force behind autonomous cars.•Software makers:  Other companies use AI to make software smarter and help solve business problems, Lippert says. Guidewire Software (GWRE), for example, uses AI to help insurers properly price policies, analyze risk, process submitted claims faster and identify insurance fraud. Adobe (ADBE) uses AI to analyze data to quickly identify cyberthreats. Datadog (DDOG) offers AI-inspired cloud monitoring services that let clients know if their web-based apps are behaving properly.FICO (FICO) is best-known for calculating consumer credit scores. It uses AI to make sense of financial data to help clients, such as banks, determine the credit worthiness of borrowers or help detect fraud, CFRA’s Freeman says.Investors who don’t want to pick their own stocks can invest in a tech-focused mutual fund or an ETF that focuses specifically on AI. Some examples include iShares Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (IRBO) and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ).“I do think AI is as significant an investing opportunity as the first era of computers,” Lippert says.Investors should expect bumps in the road investing in AI, Freeman warns.“This is a multi-decade trend,” he says. “AI is going to go through some mini-bubbles as well as some very healthy cycles.”",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-01-06T00:00:00,Adam Shell,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:14ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenSeth Goldstein, chair of Morningstar’s Electric Vehicle Committee, spends his days analyzing what’s under the hood of Tesla’s Model 3, China’s NIO ES6 SUV and Ford’s new Mustang Mach-E.That’s because for now the best potential stock investments in the electric vehicle (EV) business, which hit a soft spot in 2019, aren’t necessarily the carmakers managing the capital-intensive shift away from gas-powered autos, the Wall Street analyst says. It's companies that produce the computer chips, parts that enable electrification, and metals like lithium for longer-lasting batteries that he’s more upbeat on.“As (EVs) gain wider adoption over the next decade or two, I see a lot of good long-term opportunities owning high-quality companies throughout the entire EV supply chain,” Goldstein tells USA TODAY.When it comes to EV investing, there are pure plays like electric-vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). But there are also opportunities to invest in semiconductor makers like Nvidia (NVDA), which produce chips that act as the EV’s brain.Or you could buy shares of Albemarle (ALB), a leading producer of low-cost lithium, a key component in EV batteries. Or you could put your money to work in diversified auto parts maker BorgWarner (BWA), which benefits from making parts for gas-powered engines and its emerging revenue streams from electric vehicle components.Investors are making a bet on EVs going mainstream. The global sales outlook is promising.EV sales, which first topped 1 million globally in 2017 and hit 2 million in 2018, are expected to increase to 4 million by 2020 and 21 million by 2030, according to a Deloitte report.EV’s share of the total automotive market (now roughly 2%) is expected to grow rapidly, reaching 10% by 2024, Deloitte says. China is the biggest EV market, accounting for roughly half of sales, followed by Europe and the U.S.On the rise:Jaguar's new, all-electric I-PACE is scratching at Tesla's doorVW electric cars:Company predicts it will produce 1 million per year by 2023A critical change is expected in 2022, when the cost of an electric vehicle will fall enough to equal the cost of a gas-powered car.“With costs of ownership no longer a barrier to purchase, (electric vehicles) will become a realistic, viable option for any new car buyer,” Deloitte concluded.Electrification of transportation is a trend that’s not going away, creating long-term growth opportunities for investors.“We are generally pretty bullish on EV technology,” says Pawel Wroblewski, an international growth stock fund manager at ClearBridge Investments. “Electrified cars are a disruptive technology.”Four trends are driving the mass adoption of electric vehicles, says Asutosh Padhi, senior partner at McKinsey & Co. “More customers are actually considering electric vehicles,” Padhi said in a video on McKinsey’s website, noting that 30% to 45% of vehicle buyers in the U.S., Germany and China now consider an EV.Why did my electric bill go up?

Finding your carrier’s flavor of 5G requires a taste for investigation  The Daily Money: Subscribe to our newsletterThe economics of EV ownership has also improved. McKinsey says battery costs have fallen about 80% since 2010, and they’re expected to decline by another 50% in the next few years. Government regulations and policies, such as stricter emissions and fuel-economy targets, are favorable to environmentally-friendly electric vehicles.Finally, car-charging infrastructure has improved, although some regions of the U.S. are farther ahead than others.So how should someone interested in investing in EVs go about it?Buy ‘pure’ plays like TeslaTesla isn’t devoid of challenges. It must prove it can post consistent profits, control costs, meet production and delivery targets, fend off rivals, cope with a recent sales slowdown in China and roll out new models. But the electric car maker, which surprised Wall Street with third-quarter 2019 earnings of 78 cents a share vs. an expected loss, remains an industry leader working towards sustainable profitability.Analyst Sam Korus at ARK Invest, a firm that’s bullish on Tesla, says the stock will double in price the next five years even under the firm’s most downbeat forecast – and could climb to $4,000 per share if ARK’s bull case plays out. Shares traded at over $450 on Friday. Tesla has four competitive advantages working in its favor, Korus says. Tesla EVs have a much longer range than competitors when it comes to battery life. Their ability to send over-the-air software updates provides another edge. Tesla’s self-driving technology also gives it a lead in the autonomous car race, as does its unmatched collection of real-world driving data. ARK‘s bear case assumes Tesla’s plan to launch a fully autonomous taxi network doesn’t happen, reducing its global EV market share from 17% to 6%. Under that scenario, it would sell roughly 1.7 million to 2 million cars in 2023, which would still enable its stock to double in the next five years, ARK says. The bull case assumes Tesla’s self-driving fleet projections pan out, which would boost Tesla vehicle sales to roughly 6 million.Investors who expect a sales rebound in China and continued long-term growth can consider Chinese electric carmaker NIO, adds Wroblewski. NIO shares, hurt by a 2019 sales slowdown, are trading far below their 52-week high.Buy chipmakersThe more technologically advanced autos become, the greater the need for semiconductors. Chips are needed to power EV batteries and powertrain components, as well as provide software and firmware updates.  The shift to self-driving cars also boosts chip demand.“Chips are like the brains of the vehicle,” Korus says.Chip stocks with EV exposure, analysts say, include Nvidia, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and TE Connectivity (TEL). Electric charging station:Volkswagen is working on an autonomous robot to juice your batteryBuy auto parts suppliersThe companies selling EV parts and components will benefit from the mass adoption of electrified vehicles and bulk sales to “fleet” buyers like Amazon, analysts say.Korus owns auto parts supplier Aptiv (APTV) in his fund. “If you don’t have the expertise in manufacturing and EV, they give you the parts to make one,” he says.Investors that want to hedge their bets should consider BorgWarner. The established auto parts maker is a diversified way to play the transition from gas-powered cars to EVs, as it will generate revenue streams from both types of vehicles during the multi-year shift to electrified and autonomous transportation, says Morningstar’s Goldstein.Oddly, even though batteries are the key component that propel EVs down the nation’s highways, Korus views battery makers as offering less value to investors, mainly because batteries are quickly becoming commoditized.Analysts are less bullish on car manufacturers now diving into EV, such as Ford, GM and Volkswagen. The reason: Profits will be held back by still-high EV manufacturing costs relative to gas-powered cars.Automakers also face the balancing act of investing for the EV future while simultaneously meeting increasingly strict emissions standards and government regulations on existing gas-powered vehicles, Goldstein says.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-01-01T00:00:00,Samuel Stebbins,"The United States, according to World Bank estimates, has some of the worst income inequality in the developed world. And in recent years, the problem only appears to be getting worse.In addition to a range of macroeconomic causes, including globalization, deregulation, and the decline of workers’ unions, exorbitant executive compensation packages are also partially to blame for the growing inequality. A recent report released by the Economic Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, found that the average CEO pay at the 350 largest U.S. companies climbed by over 1,000% in the last 40 years. Meanwhile, wages for the average worker climbed by less than 12%. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed CEO compensation for the 2018 fiscal year from Equilar, a corporate data firm, to identify the 25 highest-paid CEOs of the year.

More often than not, the amount the CEO took home last year is hundreds and even thousands of times the salaries of their typical employee. To contrast CEO pay with the average worker’s salary is not to suggest that many chief executives are not worthy of higher pay. Being the highest ranking executive in a company means making major corporate decisions, managing resources and operations while also being a public figurehead – all of which can have profound implications, particularly at some of the world’s most valuable companies, like those on this list. The multimillion and billion-dollar compensation packages on this list beg the question: How much is too much?25.

They expect volatility to return in the midst of a U.S. presidential election. Some investors wait for stocks to get cheaper before they step in and scoop up buying opportunities. Companies poised to outperform, they say, will be ones that can continue to grow their earnings even if the economy slows.From iPhone maker Apple to beverage giant Coca-Cola to e-commerce titan Amazon, USA TODAY offers 20 stock picks for 2020 based on research reports and interviews with Wall Street stock analysts.'Tis the season:Santa Claus rally poised to give 401(k) plans a boostWorried about the stock market?:How to shield your 401(k) in 2020Apple (AAPL)Strong anticipated demand for Apple’s 5G iPhone next fall is projected to boost the company in 2020, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson. In December, Olson reiterated his ""overweight"" rating on the stock and raised his 12-month price target to $305 from $290, citing robust iPhone demand and better-than-expected performance in wearables such as the Apple Watch, AirPods and AirPods Pro. Apple shares finished Thursday at $289.91.Microsoft (MSFT)Analysts at Bank of America named Microsoft one of the firm’s top software picks for 2020, driven by growth in the software giant’s cloud-computing unit that offers data storage. Analysts at the bank bumped up their price target on the stock to $200 from $162. Shares closed Thursday at $158.67. The stock outperformed the broader market in 2019, rising more than 50% while the S&P 500 rose nearly 30%. Amazon (AMZN)Amazon’s stock is expected to benefit from strong growth in its cloud-computing and advertising businesses. Investors have been concerned about a hit to profits from the costs of one-day shipping and investments in Amazon Web Services, but those worries are largely priced into the stock, according to UBS analyst Eric Sheridan. He gave the stock a ""buy"" rating with a $2,100 price target over the next 12 months. Amazon's stock closed Thursday at $1,868.77. Coca-Cola (KO)Looking for a stock that pays steady dividends? Coca-Cola can satisfy investors’ thirst with its stable earnings growth and ability to ride out volatility, analysts say. Sean King, analyst at UBS, gave the beverage giant a ""buy"" rating with a $63 price target. Shares finished at $55.02 Thursday.Disney (DIS)Disney is among one of the top stock picks in media, largely driven by the success of its entrance into the streaming world with Disney Plus. In November, Bernie McTernan, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, reiterated a ""buy"" rating on the stock amid strong subscriber growth and increased his price target to $175 from $170, up from Thursday's close of $145.70. Nike (NKE)Wall Street expects Nike’s solid digital sales growth to continue as the company transitions from a wholesale retailer to a digital direct-to-consumer model. In a note to investors, Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger reiterated the firm’s ""overweight"" rating on the athletic-apparel company and raised its price target to $118 from $108. Shares of Nike finished Thursday at $100.71. T-Mobile (TMUS)T-Mobile’s stock is projected to rise over the next year despite what happens with its pending merger with Sprint, experts say. Jonathan Atkin, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, maintained an ""outperform"" rating on the telecom giant and lifted its price target to $94 from $87, citing subscriber momentum. That's up from Thursday's closing price of $77.40. Alphabet (GOOGL)Google parent Alphabet was among the worst-performing this year among its larger tech peers, but Wall Street keeps a close eye on the stock. The company was fined $1.7 billion this year for restricting rivals' ads in Europe, though some of its antitrust issues are beginning to wane. Jason Bazinet, an analyst at Citigroup, reiterated the firm’s ""buy"" recommendation and boosted its 12-month price target to $1,500 from $1,450. The stock ended Thursday at $1,362.47. Goldman Sachs (GS)Investment banks and financial services companies  such as Goldman Sachs are poised to benefit from the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates low next year because of the firm's lack of interest rate and credit risk, says Keith Horowitz, analyst at Citigroup. The bank upgraded shares of Goldman Sachs to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" and boosted its price target to $255 from $220. Thursday, shares closed at $231.21. Micron Technology (MU)The slumping memory chip industry could be turning a corner. Analysts expect demand for memory chips used in PCs, servers and USB drives to accelerate in 2020 as  trade tensions thaw. Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson upgraded Micron to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"" and lifted his price target to $65 from $44, up from the stock's closing price of $55.11 Thursday. McDonald's (MCD)Shares of McDonald’s underperformed the broader market in 2019, but its CEO shake-up, along with its innovative menu options and expansion of delivery capabilities, could drive revenue growth. Christopher Carril, an equity research analyst at RBC Capital Markets, initiated coverage on the stock in December with an ""outperform"" rating and target price of $218. The stock finished Thursday at $197.06. PayPal (PYPL)PayPal is in the midst of winding down its financial ties to former parent company eBay, which some investors fear will be an earnings obstacle. Analysts say PayPal is in a strong position to drive account growth after forming partnerships with four high-growth platforms: Facebook, Uber, Paymentus and Mercado Libre. Mark Palmer, analyst at BTIG, reiterated a ""buy"" rating on PayPal with a price target of $130, up from Thursday's closing price of $109.75. Diamondback Energy (FANG)The production outlook for Diamondback Energy looks promising. The driller, which has a strong balance sheet and reinvests in growth, is based in Permian Basin in West Texas, the heart of the U.S. shale boom. The company is expected to grow oil volumes by double digits next year. Raymond James analyst John Freeman maintained a ""strong buy"" rating on the stock with a $110 price target.

Higher spending on credit and debit cards is forecast to drive profit and revenue growth in the coming quarters. Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette raised his price target for Visa to $220 from $207, up from Thursday's closing price of $189.16. United Health (UNH)Analysts at Goldman Sachs are bullish on United Health, the parent of the nation's largest health insurer, because of the company’s projected earnings growth. Analysts at the firm gave United Health a ""buy"" rating, with a $330 price target. Shares trade around $295. Netflix (NFLX)Netflix, which missed its subscriber-growth targets for two straight quarters, faces more competition next year. Rival streaming services jumping into the fray include Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, along with traditional media companies such as NBCUniversal’s Peacock and WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. Still, Wall Street’s forecasts for the subscriber growth of Netflix are too low, according to Heath Terry, analyst at Goldman Sachs. He maintained his ""buy"" rating on the stock with a $400 price target. Shares finished Thursday at $332.63. Tesla (TSLA)Tesla’s fourth-quarter profitability is on an upward trajectory, thanks to strong demand for its Model 3 sedan, experts say. Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush, raised the automaker’s 12-month price target to $370 from $270.

If Tesla is able to sustain its level of profitability and demand in Europe and China, it could open the door to a new chapter of growth for the company, he said. Salesforce (CRM)Some analysts are bullish on Salesforce because of the cloud software company’s long-term growth prospects. The company seeks to grow in areas beyond cloud applications such as data visualization tools with its $15 billion acquisition of Tableau.  This month, JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy reaffirmed his ""overweight"" rating for the stock with a $200 price target, up from its closing price of $164.51 Thursday.American Electric Power (AEP)Investors eye American Electric Power because of the utility company's growing profits.

Tesla also hinted at a strong third quarter, saying it’s entering the period with a backlog of orders.CEO Elon Musk set investors’ expectations high in a June 25 companywide email, saying the electric-car maker was on course to deliver a record number of cars throughout the quarter. He wasn’t exaggerating. The company delivered 95,200 cars during the the three months ending June 30 –  a 51.1% increase over an admittedly weak first quarter and besting its previous record of 90,700 deliveries set in the fourth quarter of 2018.Tesla’s deliveries are a closely watched industry number and the nearest reflection of sales, showing how many cars were actually delivered to customers.Worth a look:Kevin Durant sells gorgeous $12 million Malibu beach house before move to Nets“Challenges remain, but this is a step in the right direction,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. “The numbers were above even the bull estimates and shows a clear rebound for the company. This is a feather in the cap for Tesla.”Tesla’s deliveries also blew away analysts’ estimates of 91,000, according to data compiled by FactSet. A disappointing 63,000 vehicles were delivered during the first three months of the year, when Tesla was plagued by challenges transporting cars from its factory in Fremont, California, across the world as well as questions about waning customer demand.“In addition, we made significant progress streamlining our global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes, enabling cost efficiencies and improvements to our working capital position,” the company said in announcing its results.Tesla’s orders aren’t fully reflected in its delivery numbers until a buyer takes possession of their new car. The company said 7,400 vehicles were still in transit, but not yet delivered, during the second quarter. Those sales will show up in its third-quarter report. Like sitting on a gold mine:If you bought a house in San Francisco 10 years ago, here’s how much it could be worth nowTesla is facing increased competition for the high-end electric sports car market as automakers from Ford to Jaguar invest billions of dollars to develop their own electric lineups. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz began taking orders in May for new battery-electric vehicles with plans to roll out more models in the coming years. Jaguar’s I-Pace all-electric SUV swept industry awards at the New York Auto Show in April.Deliveries for the company’s biggest seller, the Model 3, the company were 77,550 compared with 74,100 estimated by analysts. Combined deliveries for the Model S sedans and Model X SUVs were 17,650, also beating estimates of 16,600, according to FactSet data.“Delivery numbers are important, but we need to see the tea leaves look good for the second half,” Ives said in an interview. Tesla’s production target for the year is “still an Everest task, especially with competition coming at them from all angles. The real question is going to be is this sustainable?”Tesla told investors in April it expected to “deliver between 90,000 and 100,000 vehicles in Q2. Although it is possible to deliver a higher number of vehicles.”The company also recently lost one of its top manufacturing executives at its Fremont plant, Peter Hochholdinger, who was vice president of production.Tesla’s stock has lost almost a third of its value over the last year and had a market value of about $40.2 billion on Monday.Are you one of them? Over 8 million homeowners are leaving big money on the table by not refinancingContributing: Lora Kolodny, CNBC©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

",2019-02-28T00:00:00,Dalvin BrownUSA TODAY,"Tesla’s $35,000 Model 3 has arrived.The latest Tesla release comes with a redesigned interior and shorter battery life – 220 miles a charge compared with the 264 miles a charge that the midrange model has.The electric automaker also released a new slightly boosted version of the Model 3, the Standard Range Plus, which gets 240 miles per charge and starts at $37,000.Delivery of the vehicles will take about two to four weeks, the website says. Tesla's budget version of the Model 3 includes manual seat and steering adjustment, cloth seats and basic audio. It offers a top speed of 130 mph and can go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. Black is the only no-cost exterior color for the cheapest model. Tesla also said it was shifting all of its sales to online. The move helps enable the company to lower all vehicle prices by about 6 percent on average, Tesla said in a blog post.Buyers will have a seven-day or 1,000-mile trial period within which they can bring back the vehicle for a full refund, Tesla said. This is an extension of the automaker's prior three-day trial period.""Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free,"" Tesla said in the post. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long billed the Model 3 as a mass-market compact sedan, aiming to release a version of the vehicle that costs $35,000, which could be the sweet spot seeing as though its fast and expensive $69,500-and-up Model S and X electric sedans are out of reach for most consumers. Status change:Tesla stock falls after Consumer Reports drops Model 3 recommendationMore Model 3:Tesla stock falls after Consumer Reports drops Model 3 recommendation“The whole point of Tesla was to build a great affordable electric car,” Musk said at a gathering of employees and a few dozen media for the rollout of the first Model 3 cars in 2017. “That’s what this day means. I’m confident it’ll be the best car in its class, gasoline or not, hands down.”Leading up to the announcement Thursday, Tesla suspended orders of all cars on its website.The order screen was replaced with a message that read ""the wait is almost over.""On Wednesday, Musk caused a stir after posting a cryptic message on Twitter, and Tesla's stock initially rose about 5 percent. It remains unclear whether Telsa approved of Musk's tweets about the Model 3 announcement. The billionaire CEO has come under fire by the SEC for his use of the social networking website. On Monday, the SEC filed a claim against Musk for not complying with an agreement reached with the Wall Street regulatory agency in late September. The SEC accused Musk of securities fraud after the Tesla chairman tweeted that  “Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019.”More:SEC asks judge to consider holding Tesla CEO Elon Musk in contempt of court over tweetMusk, who's known for dropping subtle hints about the American automotive company on social media, made changes to his Twitter bio on Wednesday. His Twitter name was changed to ""Elon Tusk"" and he added an elephant emoji.He also had changed his photo to a picture of Mars with the word ""Revive"" on it.

",2019-01-18T00:00:00,Mike SniderUSA TODAY,"Describing a ""very difficult"" road ahead, Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday said the automaker would cut its staff by about 7 percent.The Palo Alto, California-based company grew by 30 percent last year, but struggles to remain profitable at that staffing level, Musk said in a memo to Tesla employees also posted on the company's website. The company had a ""tiny profit"" in the third quarter and expects to post an even smaller one in the fourth quarter, Musk said. Tesla must make the job cuts as it ramps up production of the Model 3, he said.""While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people,"" Musk said. ""We will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles.""A 7 percent staff reduction would mean about 3,150 employees would be let go, based on Musk's tweet in October that Tesla has 45,000 employees.""We unfortunately have no choice but to reduce full-time employee headcount by approximately 7 percent ... and retain only the most critical temps and contractors,"" Musk said.More:Tesla delivers profit: 'Many argued' it was 'impossible,' CEO Elon Musk saysElon Musk:Tesla will end its buyer referral program on Feb. 1More:Tesla to stop selling cheapest versions of Model S and Model X, says Elon MuskTesla delivered more than 245,000 electric cars and SUVs last year, nearly as many as all previous years combined. But its 2018 production fell far short of a goal set nearly three years ago of manufacturing 500,000 vehicles for the year. That goal was announced in May 2016 based on advance orders for its mid-range Model 3, which Musk said sells for $44,000.""Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 at $35k and still be a viable company,"" Musk said. ""There isn't any other way.""Tesla’s shares fell earlier this month after it cut vehicle prices by $2,000 and announced fourth-quarter sales figures that fell short of Wall Street estimates. The company faces growing competition from other automakers including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Nissan.“Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we’re up against massive, entrenched competitors,” he said. ""The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products.""“Attempting to build affordable clean energy products at scale necessarily requires extreme effort and relentless creativity,” he said in the memo, “but succeeding in our mission is essential to ensure that the future is good, so we must do everything we can to advance the cause.”Tesla will begin selling the Model 3 in Europe and China in February, a significant milestone in the company's global goals. Its factory in Shanghai is its first outside the United States.Tesla (TSLA) shares fell 13 percent to close at $302.26 on Friday. While the ""knee jerk reaction"" to the company's news may be negative, the long-term view for Tesla is positive, said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives in a note to investors.""We continue to believe Tesla will be able to emerge from the next 12 to 18 months a stronger, profitable more product diversified (geographically and price points) EV company helping lay the groundwork for Model 3 as a linchpin of growth going forward into 2020 and beyond,"" wrote Ives, whose firm maintains an ""Outperform"" rating on Tesla's stock.The staffing reductions come after a tumultuous year for Musk and Tesla. In September, the CEO agreed to step down as company chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine as part of a fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC had filed a complaint charging Musk with making a ""false and misleading"" statement when he tweeted in August that the company had enough funding to go private.Also in September, Musk was seen apparently smoking marijuana in a video podcast with comedian Joe Rogan. The Tesla CEO had described 2018 as ""the most difficult and painful"" year of his career in an interview with The New York Times.That led media mogul turned sleep advocate Arianna Huffington to issue an open letter to Musk suggesting he get more rest.He replied in his own tweet: ""Ford & Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy,'' he replied.

It is not.''Contributing: The Associated PressDetroit Auto Show:Tesla under pressure as Ford, Nissan and GM roll out new competitionMore:Elon Musk says there's a '70 percent' chance he will make the trip to MarsMore:'Let him get high': Neil deGrasse Tyson defends Elon Musk, compares Tesla CEO to Thomas EdisonFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider. ",tesla,usatoday,,

",2018-10-22T00:00:00,The Editorial Board,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:571:09ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenFor the past 30 years, stock analysts and financial reporters have frequently boosted two investing archetypes: the “it” company and the superstar CEO.Never mind that many of those “it” companies — Enron, Yahoo, Snap — were greatly overhyped, or worse. And never mind that many of those CEOs, such as General Electric’s Jack Welch and ExxonMobil’s Lee Raymond, owed their success more to good timing than to superlative managerial skills. The race to champion the champions was seemingly unstoppable.Now comes the story of electric carmaker Tesla, which combines both archetypes. Its car line has dazzled, with one of its early models earning the highest car rating ever awarded by Consumer Reports. Its CEO, Elon Musk, has long been seen as a visionary, someone who could not only build swell new cars but also figure out the riddles of affordable space travel, practical solar energy and hyperfast underground transportation networks.We don’t know how well Tesla will ultimately fare. But we can’t help but be amazed by how quickly it has gone from unstoppable force to an object lesson for the need to refrain from excessive enthusiasm.OPPOSING VIEW:Tesla shareholders, not the SEC, should hold the leashIts stock is down from a high of more than $383 last year to $261 on Monday. Musk has, with just a few tweets, gotten himself and the company in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission and come off more like an immature techie than a capable business leader.This combination — a suddenly out-of-favor company and a CEO behaving badly — is a good example of why the hype machine from Wall Street and the financial media does the public a disservice.Without doubt, Tesla makes fine cars and has been an innovator in new technologies. Even so, it is in a manufacturing industry with difficult supply chain issues and confounding politics. It also faces a slew of incumbent competitors and a reality that gasoline-powered cars are likely to remain the preferred mode of transportation for the foreseeable future.Its rapid expansion has been impressive. But to get to where it is today, making inroads in the luxury car market but still a minor player as measured in overall vehicle sales, Tesla has $9.4 billion in long-term debt and is adding to its red ink at a rapid rate.Musk, meanwhile, has gotten the company into, out of and back into trouble with his overeager fingers. In August, he reported that he was close to a deal to take the company private. He was not. And even if he had been, this is the type of announcement that affects stock prices and needs to be made through proper channels. The SEC had no choice but to sanction him.Musk was able to reach a settlement with the SEC in late September. But recently he was at it again, calling the SEC the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission.”In the long run, Tesla could zoom forward like a Model 3 accelerating to 60, or crash and burn, or something in between. One thing is highly likely: It will serve as lesson in why people should avoid irrational exuberance when it comes to buying the hype.If you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page. ",tesla,usatoday,,

",2018-10-12T00:00:00,Paul Ausick,"The handwriting was on the wall last July when Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) reached the milestone delivery of its 200,000th all-electric vehicle. That was the good news.The less-good news was that the company's federal tax credit to buyers of $7,500 would be cut in half (to $3,750) on January 1, 2019, cut in half again (to $1,875) on July 1, and disappear altogether on January 1, 2020.On the company's website this morning, this note appears on the page related to the all three of its models:All orders placed by October 15, 2018 will be delivered by the end of the year and eligible for the full $7,500 Federal Tax Credit.Tesla is just the first electric car maker to feel the impact of the reduction in the tax incentives that were passed into law in December 2010 for plug-in vehicles (hybrids like most Toyota Prius models don't qualify).A bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate earlier this week that would end the tax incentives immediately for all automakers. The legislation also includes imposing an unspecified user fee on alternative fuel vehicles to mitigate the effect of their non-payment on the federal tax on gasoline.More:A victory for Elon Musk: Tesla outsells Mercedes-Benz in US for first time everMore:Tesla CEO Elon Musk apparently rips SEC after deal: 'Shortseller Enrichment Commission'More:Tesla speeds up Model 3 electric car production despite Elon Musk controversyA competing bill was introduced in the U.S. House last July that eliminates the delivery threshold for plug-in vehicles and replaces it with a 10-year period during which the incentive is paid for every car made. Even that wouldn't help Tesla much. The company delivered its first all-electric Roadster in June 2009.The smart thing to do, of course, would be to raise the gasoline tax to pay for the carbon emissions of the internal combustion engines. The average passenger car on U.S. roads and highways emits 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Depending on the targeted temperature change to meet the climate goals set out in the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, American consumers would have to pay between $10 and $5,500 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions. That's an essentially meaningless range of $46 to $27,000, or, in cost per gallon, $0.09 to $240.The most significant question, of course, is what will Tesla CEO Elon Musk have to say (tweet) about the loss of the incentive. Neither bill in Congress does much, if anything, to return the federal incentive to Tesla buyers. That puts Tesla at a distinct disadvantage to BMW, Mercedes, GM and the rest when it comes to the price of a plug-in electric vehicle.Predicting what Musk might say is a fool's game, but he almost has to say something.24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

What exactly is a blue-chip stock?Answer: Blue-chip stocks are the best of the best in the stock market. They are representative of companies of high quality. Blue chips are favored by investors who want to balance low-risk investing with long-term growth potential and income.Generally, blue-chip stocks have a long-established history of profitability and growth. Most (but not all) pay dividends, and have done so for many years, often with annual increases. Blue chips are generally among the largest companies in their industry.Good examples of blue-chip stocks include companies like Nike, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. All of these businesses are profitable year after year and have excellent track records of stable dividend payments. Plus, they're titans of their respective industries.On the other hand, companies like Netflix and Tesla are generally not considered blue chips. They are large and wildly popular stocks, but they aren't the biggest players in their respective industries, nor do they have an established record of profitability. Additionally, they don't pay dividends to shareholders, and most blue-chip investors want income from their investments.More:Is it ever worth taking a 10 percent IRA early withdrawal penalty?

",2018-08-30T00:00:00,"Matthew Frankel, CFP®","PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:021:40ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenQuestion: Typical valuation metrics like the P/E ratio don't really work for fast-growing companies with no profits. What should I use instead?Answer: Rapidly growing companies can make for some pretty lucrative investment opportunities. As one example, Tesla's stock is up more than 2,000 percent since its 2010 IPO, despite that the company has yet to produce a full-year profit. However, this lack of profitability can make them difficult to value.There are several metrics you can use to value stocks without earnings. One method I like to use involves a combination of a company's price-to-sales ratio and its revenue growth rate. (I'll invest in a company with no earnings, but never in a company with no sales.)Let's look at a pair of examples. One of my favorite high-growth companies that has yet to turn a serious profit is Square. The fin-tech company has a market capitalization of $21.8 billion, and its second-quarter revenue, when annualized, translates to a price-to-sales ratio of 14.2. Square's adjusted revenue grew by 60 percent over the past year.Next, yet-to-be profitable social media company Snap trades for a price-to-sales ratio of 11.5 based on its annualized second-quarter sales and just reported 44 percent revenue growth. So this is a good example of how one of these variables can offset the other. Square trades for a more ""expensive"" price-to-sales ratio but also is growing at a faster rate.There are other valuation metrics that don't involve earnings that you can use as well. Book value per share is a good one, as are the debt-to-equity and the enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratios. And if a company is particularly cash-rich, that should also be taken into consideration. The point is that even if a company doesn't have earnings, there are plenty of metrics you can use to get a pretty thorough picture of its valuation. Matthew Frankel, CFP® owns shares of SQ.

Overall, the consensus of all Wall Street analysts is for a quarterly loss of $2.76 per share, according to Langan.""We are cautious on Tesla's second quarter results,"" Langan wrote in the report. ""Our sell thesis remains focused on cash burn, sustainable profitability, and quality concerns.""So why, aside from Langan betting that Tesla won't make money again next year, is the analyst predicting that the stock will shed a third of its value by this time next year?More Money:Are you ready for the next recession? How to prepare now for a potential downturnMore Money:More summer jobs turn permanent as employers struggle to find good workersMore Money:Ginger ale doesn't contain any real ginger, lawsuit allegesShort-term pricing boost to fadeTesla recently changed its Model 3 ordering rules by removing the $1,000 down payment to reserve a car. Under the new system, reservation holders and new customers alike must pay a $2,500 deposit to move their orders forward.In the short term, Tesla, which has a goal of selling the Model 3 at $35,000 to the masses, is only offering models ranging in price from $49,000 to $80,000 for ones loaded with options, Langan says. The new deposit plan, he says, will drive sales and revenue in the short term as buyers trade up to the more expensive versions.The benefits of the ""pull forward"" pricing, however, ""will not be sustainable as prices normalize,"" Langan says, noting the high price point of the Model 3 compared to comparable vehicles such as the BMW 3-Series ($43,000) and the Mercedes C-Class (around $47,000). ""As the (Model 3) price normalizes to the mid $40,000 range, we expect significant margin compression,"" Langan told clients.  More:Tesla's limited-edition surfboard sells out in just one dayMore:Tesla to suppliers: We want our money backMore:Tesla ditches reservations, opens up Model 3 car sales to all customers in North AmericaNeed to raise more capital likely""Tesla will likely need to raise capital by the fourth quarter,"" Langan predicted in his research note. While Tesla had about $2.6 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, according to Langan, he estimates that the company burned through $900 million in the second quarter, leaving it with more than the $1 billion cushion that it needs.However, Tesla has about $500 million in debt to refinance by the end of the year and also has roughly $750 million in liabilities outstanding, mostly related to the construction of its Gigafactory in China. These numbers, Langan adds, don't include higher future expenditures for Tesla's Model Y and the assembly of the Gigafactory, as well as other future costs.Bad news piling upFor the most part, Tesla investors have shrugged off the the electric-car maker's string of negative headlines, ranging from CEO Elon Musk's strange behavior during a first-quarter earnings call with analysts, when he criticized the line of questioning as ""boring,"" to recent news about cutting 9 percent of its workforce, closing solar facilities, asking suppliers for cash back and assembling some vehicles in a tent.Those are ""all signs of financial challenges,"" Langan wrote in his report.  ",tesla,usatoday,,

",2018-06-22T00:00:00,Adam ShellUSA TODAY,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:58ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenThe list of companies caught in the brewing trade war between the U.S. and China reads like a who's who of American commerce: Boeing, Caterpillar, Deere, Tesla. By virtue of their sizable business in China, shares of these and other brand-name U.S. stocks are at risk if the trade spat between the world's two largest economies worsens.More pain is ahead if tariffs are announced that go beyond the initial $34 billion of the $50 billion targeting hundreds of Chinese goods that President Donald Trump says will go into effect July 6. China has retaliated with tariffs of equal value aimed at U.S. products. The U.S. is also drawing up a list of $200 billion more of additional Chinese goods that could be subject to tariffs.A tariff is an import tax countries levy on goods entering their borders. It's a tactic used to protect their own economies with the hope of keeping domestic companies competitive.  The biggest losers? U.S. corporations that get a hefty chunk of their sales from China or those that sell products on Beijing's growing list of U.S. products that will be hit with an import tax ranging from 15 to 25 percent.Wall Street fears business will slow for these firms, as their products will be more expensive for Chinese shoppers and manufacturers. That's bearish for stocks, as higher prices can lead to fewer sales and smaller profits and ultimately lower share prices. Here are some U.S. stocks facing a tariff-related hit:Boeing (BA)The airplane maker earned nearly 13 percent of its revenue in China in the past fiscal year, according to Bloomberg. Its share price was down more than 9 percent thru Thursday afternoon trading since its recent high June 6, due largely to the escalating trade dispute. In November, Boeing struck a deal to sell a state-run Chinese company 300 planes for $37 billion. Any loss of orders due to trade tensions would be costly. ""Aircraft deliveries to China have a growing importance to Boeing,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani noted in a report. Caterpillar (CAT)Big industrial companies such as Caterpillar that sell into China's fast-growing economy, which grew 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year, are also vulnerable to a slowdown triggered by a trade dispute. The company's shares have slid about 9 percent in the five trading sessions since Trump announced he was going through with tariffs against China and warned of $200 billion more in levies. Caterpillar, which sells iconic yellow-colored excavators and other earth-moving machines, has roughly two dozen facilities in China. The company said about half of its first-quarter 2018 revenue in its construction business was mainly in North America and China. Part of the reason it increased its forecast for full-year earnings was a ""strengthening"" of its construction business across Asia, but primarily in China, it said.Deere (DE)The maker of tractors, combines and harvesters could be hit with a double whammy in the trade dispute. Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel will have a negative financial impact because it will cost Deere more to build its heavy equipment with higher-priced steel. China has also targeted U.S. farmers by levying tariffs on soybeans, wheat and other agricultural crops that are harvested by Deere machines. And if sales of these commodities falter, purchases of that equipment by U.S. farmers could also take a hit. Tesla (TSLA)Fatal crashes, production bottlenecks and alleged employee sabotage aren't the only problems Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing. Tesla makes one of the products on China's updated list of potential tariff victims: electric cars. And that's bad news for the upstart automaker as it made Morgan Stanley's top-20 list of stocks with the highest revenue exposure to China. Tesla gets 19 percent of its sales from China. The 25 percent tariff set to take effect July 6 could put the price of a Tesla out of reach for many Chinese buyers.BorgWarner (BWA)The auto parts supplier has two things working against it: One, it gets an estimated 13 percent of its revenues directly from China, according to Morgan Stanley. Two, it sells clean-tech components to companies that build hybrid and electric cars, which are targeted by Beijing. BorgWarner shares are down nearly 6 percent since Trump confirmed last Friday that he was moving forward with planned tariffs against China.Qualcomm (QCOM)The company just happens to be in the industry that Morgan Stanley says has the highest exposure (52 percent) to China: semiconductors and chip equipment makers. Qualcomm, whose processors are used in mobile phones, gets 65 percent of its revenue from China, according to Bloomberg, putting it – and other chip makers such as Micron, Intel and Invidia – at risk.Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD)The global transportation company moves goods around the world via air and sea. It also provides services such as temperature-controlled transit, cargo insurance and logistics management. That's all good, except for the fact that it gets an estimated 30 percent of sales from business ties with China, Morgan Stanley data show.Tiffany (TIF)The upscale jewelry seller, known for its signature blue box, diamond rings and edgier image under new CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, is a favorite of China's growing class of aspirational shoppers. While that's a plus in good times, it could cause problems during periods of trade strife if Chinese shoppers turn away from U.S. retailers such as Tiffany or if the economy slows, making jewelry sold by Tiffany's less affordable. The jeweler gets roughly 14 percent of its revenue from China, Morgan Stanley data show, which makes them even more vulnerable if China retaliates with tariffs on products it sells. Cummins (CMI)Cummins, which makes products including diesel and natural gas engines, gets 10 percent of its revenue from China, according to Bloomberg, and is the type of industrial company that can be dinged by the tariff fight.A.O. Smith (AOS)One of the world's leading manufacturers of water heaters for homes and commercial buildings also ranks high when it comes to exposure to China. Bloomberg pegs its China sales at nearly 35 percent. In this year's first quarter, sales in China rose 13 percent measured in U.S. dollars, the company said in its earnings release.    ",tesla,usatoday,,

",2018-04-30T00:00:00,Marco della CavaUSA TODAY,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:35ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenSAN FRANCISCO — Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, don't take criticism lightly, a stance that has helped rally customers and investors alike during a tumultuous 15-year run.But while it's one thing to fire back at critical auto reviewers or skeptical financial analysts, that strident defense can come off as cold when it follows the death of a customer using Autopilot or reports of injury and harassment at a factory.And that could be a problem for a company hoping to shift gears this year  from a niche provider of $100,000 techie status symbols to a mainstream manufacturer of $35,000 autos, the Model 3, for average Americans.Its progress on that front will become more clear late Wednesday when it reports financial results, which will be scrutinized for the production of its new Model 3 cars and signs it has enough cash to survive.""You need to show empathy when there’s a consumer-facing product involved,” says Michael Meath, crisis communications expert and visiting professor at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School.""The way Musk  carries himself is innovative and unconventional, but he can also be cavalier,"" he says. ""The price of admission for developing a new tech product is a higher level of care and concern when something doesn’t go right.”A down-to-earth Musk 2.0 may play better with heartland buyers who increasingly will have electric car options from automakers ranging from General Motors to Volvo, says Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Cox Automotive.“Elon doesn’t just do his own thing, he revels in throwing it in everyone’s face,” he says. That doesn't work as well for a large, mature automaker.  Musk’s style and his mainstream mission could be on a “collision course,” Brauer says.Tesla declined to provide Musk for an interview and said it stands by its statements in the wake of past incidents.Tech's 'break things' culture at playThere are constituents who would likely celebrate Tesla's demise, namely investors short-selling the stock and established automakers eager for one less competitor.Tesla's (TSLA) market value $48 billion — just under General Motors' value of $53 billion despite Tesla's relatively low car production — helps generate media scrutiny of its every move.But even allowing for some understandable defensiveness, Tesla's responses to criticism contrast with the more contrite public comments many consumer companies take after a fatality or serious problem, whether or not the blame is immediately clear.Musk and Tesla's eagerness to defend their position has surfaced in instances such as:— A crash in Florida in May 2016 that killed the Tesla driver when his Model S in Autopilot mode failed to slow as a tractor-trailer cut across its path. Tesla's ""A Tragic Loss"" blog post led with a full-throated defense of Autopilot, noting ""this is the first known fatality in just over 130 million miles where Autopilot was activated."" In the last paragraph, it extended sympathies to the family. Musk later tweeted: ""Our condolences for the tragic loss.""The National Transportation Safety Board later concluded Tesla shared the blame for the crash for allowing the use of Autopilot on a road with frequent intersections. It also faulted the driver for relying on it too much. — A crash in March 2018 in Mountain View, Calif., that killed driver Walter Huang when his Model X in Autopilot mode slammed into a highway divider.Tesla's first blog post on the matter opened with a statement about how the company was ""deeply saddened"" by the death, then continued with a 500-word explanation of the technology, including Autopilot's safety record.After Huang's family hired lawyers to look into a lawsuit, the company issued a statement saying Huang “was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.""Tesla also issued a second blog post revealing details from the Model X's computer logs indicating Huang had ignored warnings to resume control of the car. The National Transportation Safety Board scolded Tesla for sharing such details during an ongoing investigation. But Musk tweeted that ""to do otherwise would be unsafe.""More:Elon Musk fires back at National Transportation Safety Board as his bad spell continues— Accusations by some workers and reports by media outlets that its factory in Fremont, Calif., has seen incidents of racism, sexism and, most recently, underreported worker injuries. The factory is at the center of Tesla's output goals and recently announced 24/7 shifts aimed at spurring Model 3 production to 6,000 cars a week.Three African-American former workers sued Tesla last year claiming they suffered daily harassment, including being called a racial slur. Tesla deflected the claims, noting that the former employees hadn't brought any claims before and worked there only a short time.The complaint included comments from Musk in a May 2017 memo to factory employees after previous harassment and discrimination complaints where he advised, ""In fairness, if someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology.""A lengthy investigation by the Center for Investigative Reporting's Reveal team, anchored to interviews with former Tesla safety engineers, said the company's injury numbers were improving due to underreporting. Tesla slammed the report as an ""ideologically motivated attack by an extremist organization.""What's on Musk's mind is usually only a check of Twitter away, where he is known for missives that range from arch to tart when Tesla's stumbles are raised.For example, after Tesla introduced its Model S electric sedan, one reviewer found fault with its battery’s cold-weather performance. Musk’s response was swift. “Article about Model S range is fake,” Musk tweeted in February 2013, inadvertently getting a jump on the 'fake news' outcry. “Vehicle logs tell true story.”There was a smackdown of a transportation consultant who suggested Musk's views were elitist (""You're an idiot,"" Musk tweeted) and a dismissal of critics questioning the company’s valuation (“Telsa is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that’s irrelevant,” Musk tweeted).Some experts suggest Musk could use a tempered second-in-command to smooth over such matters and bring Tesla out of its growing-pains stage.In a recent article for Harvard Business Review, Stanford University adjunct professor Steve Blank praised Musk’s pioneering spirit, but — citing visionary but failed General Motors founder William Durant — suggested that perhaps it’s time for a steady hand to execute the comparatively “boring” part of growing a company, much as Alfred Sloan did when he took over GM.Musk admits 'humans are underrated'There is some evidence the company realizes it may need to moderate its famously strident tone.In the blog post after the deadly Model X crash, Tesla allowed that ""in the past … we have been criticized (for bringing up data points), implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred. Nothing could be further from the truth.”Musk himself even shocked some observers by walking back statements he had made over the years about how a huge leap in automation would be a hallmark of Tesla's factories.After some of the Model 3’s delays were attributed to automation, Musk tweeted: “Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.”Silicon Valley mindsetUnderstanding Musk's approach means acknowledging the ""move fast and break things"" tech culture that helped create his first fortune at PayPal and has informed some of the brash moves of tech company peers ranging from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to Uber's deposed CEO Travis Kalanick.But it carries risk. After all, an act-first-ask-questions-later approach got Uber co-founder Kalanick forced out last year over toxic cultural and policy issues and recently landed Zuckerberg in front of Congress over serious privacy concerns.It remains to be seen if those prove cautionary tales for Musk or whether his larger-than-life personality — and considerable track record at disrupting entrenched industries  — will keep him in a defensive crouch.“Elon’s been known for unfeeling responses that cite data and don’t get to the human aspect of things,” says Ashlee Vance, author of Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future. “But that’s just how his mind works. He’s a brutally logical person.”Musk, Vance adds, ""has definitely reached full-on Steve Jobs status at this point, complete with a following of true believers.""Those include not only diehard fans and owners of his Tesla automobiles but also admirers of his forays into rocketry (SpaceX's Falcon rockets have Mars in their sights) and mass transportation (his hyperloop-inspired Boring Company vision calls for a remaking of underground commuting). It is perhaps that unflagging support of believers, as much as his own personality, that could keep Musk from allowing Tesla to evolve into the kind of mainstream company that is measured and, when necessary, apologetic in the face of criticism and tragedy.“Musk’s probably created more significant companies than anyone since Edison,” Blank says. “But the problem with visionaries and founders often is once they’re proven right about one thing, they believe every vision they have is correct.”Follow USA TODAY tech writer Marco della Cava on Twitter @marcodellacava. ",tesla,usatoday,,

The inexpensive Model 3, with a price of about $35,000, is the key to Tesla becoming a mass-market car company. At one point, 400,000 people had deposits to buy the car. Production has been far enough behind that investors worry the car will not be available in enough numbers soon to positively affect Tesla’s revenue. Tesla also faces accusations that its production line has safety issues.Tesla also has had to ward off worries that its cars, once considered ultra-safe, may be prone to accidents when they are in a partial self-driving mode. A fatal accident occurred in March when the driver had the “autopilot” feature on. Tesla said the driver ignored the system’s crash warning. The accident has set up a war of words between Tesla and the National Transportation Safety Board. The dispute could make it harder for Tesla to participate in any investigation.Musk recently said Tesla will make money in 2018. That statement faces a number of skeptics. Among the reasons are the delay in the Model 3 and Tesla’s problems with suppliers. Some investors believe it is obvious Tesla will need to raise money.

",2018-04-02T00:00:00,Kevin McCoyUSA TODAY,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:12ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenTech billionaire Elon Musk's bad spell is continuing into a second month, amid a spat with a federal safety agency, an auto recall and production issues, an adverse court ruling, and a debt rating downgrade. Shares of the Musk-led electric car company Tesla (TSLA) closed down 5.1% at $252.48 in Monday trading, as the influential executive responded to National Transportation Safety Board displeasure with the firm's disclosure of preliminary details about a fatal crash.Christopher O'Neil, an NTSB spokesman over the weekend said the safety agency was unhappy with Tesla's announcement that its Autopilot partial self-driving system was engaged when a Model X electric crossover SUV crashed on March 23 in Mountain View, Cal., killing the driver. ""In each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,"" O'Neil said, according to an Associated Press report.""The NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla,"" added O'Neil.The criticism responded to Tesla's disclosure in a blog post on the company's website that logs from the SUV showed the driver's hands hadn't been detected on the steering wheel for six seconds prior to the accident. The post did not say that Tesla's Autopilot system was at fault in the crash.While professing respect for the NTSB, Musk tweeted Monday that the agency is an advisory panel, while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates cars. It would be ""unsafe"" for Tesla to delay releasing crash data that affects public safety, he added.Nonetheless, the preliminary accident details could prompt new safety questions about Autopilot, which was also engaged when a Tesla Model S sedan crashed into a truck and killed its driver in Florida last year.The Autopilot technology is a partial self-driving system, representing an enhanced version of the cruise control found in many vehicles. However, self-driving technology has come under scrutiny since an Uber car in self-driving mode struck and killed a woman crossing a street in Tempe, Ariz.Apart from the safety concerns, Tesla was hit with a legal setback last week via a Delaware Chancery Court ruling that dissatisfied Tesla investors may continue their lawsuit that challenges the firm's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, the solar energy system installer in San Mateo, Calif., founded by Musk and two of his cousins.The decision said the $2.6 billion deal was flawed by potential conflicts of interest involving Musk and other company directors. Tesla investors who filed the lawsuit provided enough evidence to show it was ""reasonably conceivable"" that Musk controlled the Tesla board, even though he is a minority stakeholder in the electric car company, the court ruled.""We do not agree with the decision and will be taking appropriate next steps,"" Tesla said in a statement last week.Last week, Tesla announced a voluntary recall of 123,000 Model S electric cars to repair a power steering bolt defect. The company took action after discovering ""excessive corrosion"" in the affected part, according to a letter issued to customers.Tesla said it had observed the defect ""only in very cold climates"" where vehicles contend with road salt. However, the company said technicians would replace all of the other power steering bolts in the recalled vehicles because the cars later might be driven in cold areas where the bolts similarly could face road salt corrosion.More:Can Elon Musk avoid the fate of John DeLorean? Tesla CEO may need to 'rethink' strategyMore:Elon Musk tripped up by legal ruling over Tesla's $2.6B acquisition of SolarCitySeparately, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Tesla's corporate family debt rating last week, citing concern about ""the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company's Model 3 electric vehicle.""Tesla is trying to rally employees to ramp up the model's production in a bid to meet predicted goals and prove ""haters"" of the company wrong, Bloomberg News reported Thursday. Musk took personal control of the Tesla division that produces the vehicles, tech news website The Information reported, citing two unidentified people briefed on the issue.The effort reportedly worked, to a degree. In a company-wide Monday email to employees, Musk said Model 3 production just passed a rate of 2,000 cars per week, according to a report by Jalopnik, a news and opinion website about cars and other modes of transportation. Although the email cited a production increase, the rate falls below the 2,500-cars-per-week revised projection Tesla issued earlier this year.The spate of recent bad news sent Tesla shares down 22.4% for March, a nosedive that marked the worst-ever month for the stock and placed the electric-car company in bear-market territory.Musk apparently sought to make light of the stock plunge and other issues by tweeting April Fool's Day jokes that Tesla could face bankruptcy.

The ruling means the case will continue to be a financial and legal challenge for Musk.""We do not agree with the decision and will be taking appropriate next steps,"" Tesla said in a statement responding to the decision. ""It’s important to emphasize that this was a motion to dismiss in which the court was required to assume as true all of the allegations that are made in the complaint. We, of course, contend the allegations in the complaint are false.""The decision came during a month in which Musk and Tesla are coping with a crisis sparked by a fatal crash in California involving one of the company's Model X cars. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are down 4% from this time last year and are 14.5% lower year-to-date. The stock closed up 3.2% at $266.13 on Thursday.The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting field research into the March 23 accident, in which a Model X SUV struck a highway median near Mountain View, Calif. and flipped into oncoming lanes, where it was struck by two vehicles.NTSB officials said it was ""unclear if automated control system was active at (the) time of crash,"" a reference to Tesla's Autopilot system.Tesla issued a March 23 statement that said the company had ""proactively reached out to the authorities to offer our assistance in investigating.""Moody's Investors Service downgraded Tesla's corporate family debt rating on Tuesday, citing concern about ""the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company's Model 3 electric vehicle.""Tesla is trying to ramp up the model's production in a bid to meet predicted goals and prove ""haters"" of the company wrong, Bloomberg News reported Thursday.The Delaware court ruling focuses on Tesla's controversial acquisition of SolarCity, a solar energy system installer in San Mateo, Calif., founded by Musk and his cousins, Peter and Lyndon Rive.At the time of the deal, Musk owned approximately 22.1% of Tesla’s stock, records in the court case showed. He also chairs Tesla's board, serves as the chief executive officer and is the company's chief product architect.Musk was a vocal public booster of the SolarCity deal. During a June 2016 conference call with investors, he called the proposed acquisition a ""no-brainer” that is ""legally and morally correct,"" as well as a ""zero-doubt"" move that ""we should have done sooner.""During an August 2016 conference call on the day Tesla announced the proposed SolarCity deal, Musk repeatedly referred to Tesla as ""my company,"" the Delaware court ruling noted.Musk served as chairman of SolarCity's board since the company's 2006 formation and held roughly 21.9% of the firm's stock prior to the proposed acquisition by Tesla, the court records show.Tesla investors cited potential conflicts involving some of the company's other directors, who endorsed the SolarCity acquisition. The officials include Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother and cousin of Lyndon and Peter Rive. At the time of the proposed acquisition, he beneficially owned 147,541 shares of SolarCity stock, records in the lawsuit show.Additionally, SolarCity's debt increased thirteen-fold, to $3.56 billion, during the three years that preceded Tesla's acquisition, the court records show. ""By any measure, SolarCity was in the midst of a liquidity crisis"" that required financial assistance at the time Tesla's acquisition was announced,"" Slights wrote in his ruling.More:More billions for Elon Musk?

",2018-03-14T00:00:00,Rich Duprey,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:013:11ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenHarley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG) wants to prove it is really serious about making electric motorcycles. Hot on the heels of announcing it will have a production e-bike ready by 2019, Harley announced it had taken a financial stake in Alta Motors, a small EV and components maker.Considering the e-bike Alta makes is nothing like the Project Livewire motorcycle Harley-Davidson unveiled a few years ago, and which purportedly informs the electric bike it's building now, how the two will mesh to form a unified whole is a big question mark.Bike sales short-circuitingHarley has a problem. It's not selling many of its big, expensive machines anymore and needs to develop a lighter, cheaper bike. With the core middle-aged male customer aging out of the bike-buying market, it needs to appeal to a new generation of riders that is younger, more urban, and female. It apparently believes an electric motorcycle that has no gears or clutch -- what Harley calls ""twist and go"" capabilities -- is the future of the industry.Buying into Alta makes sense in that regard. The bike maker has committed to investing $25 million to $30 million a year in EV technology, though how much, if any, of that commitment went to Alta is unknown as financial terms were not released. However, Alta brings some seemingly cutting-edge expertise into Harley's orbit.The EV maker's RedShift MXR is a 50-horsepower electric motocross bike that Alta says can out-accelerate a KTM 690 Enduro. It expects the RedShift to be sanctioned by the American Motorcycle Association for competition in the 250 class of motocross bikes.The technology that underpins the bike is its battery pack, for which Alta claims ""there is no smaller, more energy-dense battery pack in transportation,"" and its liquid-cooled 14,000-rpm motor is ""pound-for-pound one of the most powerful in motorsports.""The Alta investment isn't for Harley's initial production e-bike, but for what comes after, and one of the biggest questions that surround an electric motorcycle is its range.More: Jaguar I-PACE SUV: Meet the luxury brand's first-ever electric vehicleMore: Mixed review: Edmunds hits the road with Tesla's Model 3More: These electric cars want to learn from Apple's hits and Tesla's missesSparking a cash burnWhen Project Livewire was unveiled in 2014, it claimed a range of 53 miles, though it was admitted at the time that a minimum of 100 miles on a single charge would be necessary to make it viable. Alta's RedShift has a 60-mile range and can recharge in two and a half hours at 220 volts, or four and a half hours at 110 volts.One would assume that if Harley has gone into production on its e-bike, it has solved the 100-mile question, but Alta could potentially significantly increase its advanced technology over time.While the technology behind it is cool, Harley-Davidson investors will also want to know about market acceptance of an e-bike and whether the bike maker can do it profitably. Previously, I noted Polaris Industries (NYSE: PII) CEO Scott Wine is skeptical of the latter, otherwise he says his company would be all-in on the endeavor. And the automakers have yet to figure out how to make an electric car profitably despite the considerable resources that have been thrown at the problem.Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), as the auto industry's EV pure play, generated $9.6 billion in auto sales last year, but despite receiving billions in government subsidies to drive sales, it still lost $2.2 billion last year. Later this year, the federal tax credits buyers get will begin phasing out, which could push Tesla's losses higher. General Motors (NYSE: GM) says it might not be able to build a profitable EV until 2021.Big investment, little returnCertainly, an electric motorcycle should be looked at as an investment, but there is a real question as to whether it's one Harley-Davidson should be making, particularly at this moment. While there is a market for e-bikes, it's not a particularly large one. Zero Motorcycles, perhaps one of the biggest and best-known manufacturers, produces just 2,000 e-bikes a year (maybe Harley should have bought it instead).Harley-Davidson's electric motorcycle dreams still seem a bit quixotic at the moment -- and a diversion from the real problem of reversing sliding sales. It continues to produce big, expensive touring bikes when younger riders are looking for smaller, cheaper runabouts. The e-bike could fill the excitement component for Harley, but it remains a pricey option, and ultimately, they're a niche product at best.As the bike maker says, it's still committed to its ""gas and oil roots""; maybe it needs to fix that first before going off on tangents.Rich Duprey has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

These problems include Tesla needing to make some of the batteries by hand and borrowing scores of employees from one of its suppliers to help with this manual assembly, said these people.Tesla's future as a mass-market car maker hinges on automated production of the Model 3, which more than 400,000 people have already reserved, paying $1,000 refundable fees to do so.The company has already delayed production, citing problems at the Gigafactory. On November 1, 2017, CEO Elon Musk assured investors in an earnings call that Tesla was making strides to correct its manufacturing issues and get the Model 3 out.But more than a month later, in mid-December, Tesla was still making its Model 3 batteries partly by hand, according to current engineers and ex-Tesla employees who worked at the Gigafactory in recent months. They say Tesla had to ""borrow"" scores of employees from Panasonic, which is a partner in the Gigafactory and supplies lithium-ion battery cells, to help with this manual assembly.Tesla is still not close to mass-producing batteries for the basic $35,000 model of this electric sedan, sources say. These people requested anonymity as they are not authorized by the company to talk to the press.A Tesla spokesperson told CNBC, ""Until we reach full production, by definition some elements of the production process will be more manual. This is something Elon and [CTO] JB [Strausel] discussed extensively on our Q3 earnings call, and it has no impact on the quality or safety of the batteries we're producing.""Meanwhile, bears are growing more skeptical by the day. Stanphyl Capital's Mark B. Spiegel told CNBC, ""While I've no doubt that Tesla will eventually work out its Model 3 production problems, the base model will cost Tesla at least mid-$40,000s to build. The company will never deliver more than a token few for less than the current $49,000 lowest-cost offering. Sales will hugely disappoint relative to expectations of over 400,000 a year. And even at those higher prices Tesla will never come anywhere close to its promised [profitability].""A history of missing targetsTesla has a history of setting and missing ambitious targets.It reportedly aimed to ship its Model X gullwing vehicles to the masses in 2014, but couldn't do so until 2016.Last year, Elon Musk promised to deliver 1,600 Model 3s in the third quarter, but only delivered 220 of them. In a shareholders' update in August, he said the company should be producing 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of 2017. In November, he lowered expectations, saying Tesla will be able to crank out 2,500 premium Model 3s per week by the end of March, ramping up to 5,000 per week by June.According to shareholder updates, the company delivered fewer than 2,000 Model 3s through the end of 2017, and only the more expensive long-range ones. No $35,000 basic models have shipped as of mid-January.Issues at the Gigafactory could hamper Tesla's ability to hit even its reined-in goals, say sources. Delays would hurt employee morale, test the patience of customers, and help electric vehicle competitors like Chevy, Nissan, and China's BYD.But some Tesla investors view production issues as minor in the grand scheme. A note from RW Baird's Ben Kallo on Tuesday said, ""We continue to believe Tesla will be able to ramp Model 3 production, think demand could accelerate with positive reviews from early customers, and believe the Model 3 total addressable market could be larger than expected.""Some former Tesla engineers agreed, saying manufacturing and quality issues should be kept in perspective. ""Manufacturing is always hard. There are questions of tolerance and risk, what meets quality criteria and so on,"" one said. ""It takes time to figure it out.""'Slapping bandoliers together'What does it take to make a Model 3 battery? Each battery pack contains four modules. And each module contains 7 bandoliers, or cooling tubes with a row of lithium ion cells glued to each side. Those cells have to be precisely aligned.Manual assembly works for some parts of battery production, like bolting down and gluing the ""clamshells,"" or outer structures that hold a battery pack together.But bandoliers are tough to put together by hand. Cells can be pushed a bit too high or low, or otherwise drop out of alignment, as they're squeezed against the glue on a cooling tube and packed into modules.A current Gigafactory engineer recalled that in December, factory workers were manually ""slapping bandoliers together as fast as they possibly could,"" generating a lot of scrap in the process.Once the machines in the factory were able to crank out bandoliers as fast or faster than the manual laborers, Tesla began sending Panasonic workers back to their employer, sources said.Today, Tesla is dwindling down manual assembly as much as possible at the Gigafactory, a hopeful sign.But one engineer who works there cautioned that the automated lines still can't run at full capacity. ""There's no redundancy, so when one thing goes wrong, everything shuts down. And what's really concerning are the quality issues.""Many of the company's quality control workers are relatively inexperienced, make sloppy calculations and don't know when they're looking at flaws, according to several current and former employees. They said many quality inspectors were temp-to-hire workers with no automotive experience who Tesla hired via a staffing agency.Tesla acknowledged the relative inexperience of some employees, but said new hires involved in battery production receive ""extensive training, including safety training.""Two current engineers told CNBC that they are concerned some of the batteries being shipped do not have the minimum gap required between lithium ion cells. These engineers warned that this ""touching cells"" flaw could cause batteries to short out or, in worse cases, catch fire.These engineers said they raised the issue internally, but their concerns were shrugged off by managers.A Tesla spokesperson dismissed these comments as ""false claims,"" and strenuously denied the company is shipping hazardous batteries.""The implication that Tesla would ever deliver a car with a hazardous battery is absolutely inaccurate, contrary to all evidence, and detached from reality,"" the spokesperson wrote in an e-mail to CNBC.The spokesperson also explained:""Every battery in a Tesla vehicle has thousands of cells, the vast majority of which are at the same voltage potential as neighboring cells. Hypothetically, even if two cells of the same voltage potential were touching, there would be absolutely zero impact, safety or otherwise – it would be as if two neutral pieces of metal touched.""Despite this fact, all Model 3 battery modules' cell positions are measured twice in manufacturing to verify process control and quality of outgoing parts. Conversely, if at any point in the production process cells are touching at different voltage potentials, they cannot be electrically interconnected. Over the course of the production process, we conduct three different tests to ensure the right number of cells are electrically connected in Model 3 modules.""The two engineers also said that Tesla doesn't do the same kind of ""stress tests"" of its Model 3 batteries which would be expected of other electronics or car makers. Such tests could help Tesla figure out if touching cells (or any other flaws) are present in its fully assembled batteries, or if flaws develop or worsen with real-world use.Tesla countered that it tests batteries in many other ways, ""including shock and vibration, and high temperature and humidity testing, as well as thermal cycling endurance testing throughout design and via sampling in production."" The company says this testing ""is designed to prevent touching cells from being installed in any of our vehicles.""© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

That said, charging to 80% would take only 30 minutes, ""or about the time of the average driver break"" on a new solar-powered Megacharger network.More stats spilled out from there, including a 0.36 drag coefficient, a bit less than a $3 million Bugatti Chiron, thanks to a flat bottom. Musk also said the company was guaranteeing the Tesla Semi for 1 million miles.""It's like driving a Model S or Model X, but it's just big,"" Musk said, rererring to the brand's two current models, an electric luxury sedan and SUV.At that point, someone in the crowd yelled: ""Elon for president!"" Musk laughed.Two trucks sat in a large hanger-like facility, alongside two examples of conventional diesel trucks. The Tesla Semis were painted menacing black and glimmering silver. One featured spidery side view mirrors while the other did not, suggesting that Tesla engineers are playing with using cameras and screens in place of traditional mirrors.While the exterior’s smooth surfaces are eye-catching, the Tesla Semi’s interior was designed to make truck drivers swoon. In the place of a typical cramped two passenger compartment is an airy space you can walk around.By far the biggest revolution is in the driver’s seat placement. It is dead center and far forward thanks to the absence of an engine, allowing greater road visibility. A jump seat is positioned to the right and rear of the driver.From this central, Formula One-style driving position, it's easy to monitor two screens, one left, one right, offering details of the truck’s running condition and the trucker’s shipment details.The Tesla Semi has the upcoming Model 3 to thank for its existence. Beyond borrowing cockpit screens, flush door handles and the car’s Autopilot system, the Semi’s powertrain consists of four Model 3 drive axles, one powering each of the four rear wheels (the front wheels are unpowered).The battery pack for the Tesla Semi, which is located low and behind the driver, remains a mystery in terms of its construction and precise range.But as with many Musk events, the unveiling was full of flash and scant on details, including how much the sleek big rig would cost, when it would go on sale and whether Tesla had any buyers.While it might seem odd for a man aiming for Mars to tackle a truck, the appeal for Musk is the size of the market.Trucking is a $700 billion a year industry in U.S., and offering a product that could offer huge fuel cost savings has the potential to upset the diesel-powered status quo.More:Tesla troubles: 5 important takeaways from earnings reportMore:Federal agencies used port trucking companies with labor violationsMore:Tesla unveils its electric big rig truck tonightThere are roughly 4 million big rig trucks on the road today hauling a vast majority of U.S. goods around the country, according to the Diesel Technology Forum. Almost all of them run on diesel engines. In 2017, some 260,000 new big rig trucks will be on the road, according to ACT Research.Reacting to Musk’s challenge, Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum, issued a statement saying that “diesel is the most energy efficient internal combustion engine. … Aspirations and predictions for new fuels and technologies are high, but must be evaluated in the context of reality.”The reality for the Tesla Semi is that while a comfortable cab and a lower cost per mile drivetrain would be welcome by most truckers and transportation companies, implementing such an overhaul faces hurdles.Ian Wright, one of the founders of Tesla who now runs electric bus and garbage truck company Wrightspeed, welcomes the spotlight Musk has put on electrifying big vehicles, but has questions.“By addressing some of the worst polluters you can make a much bigger (environmental) impact than changing up cars,” he says. “But no one buys trucks as a fashion statement. It will be all about how much the Tesla Semi and its batteries cost, how much their weigh, and how much that weight would cut into a trucker’s payload and therefore what he stands to make.”Some analysts predict Musk may be onto something, with a caveat around charging. Musk has vowed to dot the U.S. with supercharging stations, thereby eliminating range-anxiety issues for motorists and now truck drivers.“The business case for e-trucks are viable in some scenarios,” says Brian Irwin, managing director automotive and industrials at Accenture. “While the overall market might not be ready yet, this could change, and quickly, if a better charging infrastructure solves those issues and stricture regulation increases the pressure on diesel trucks.”Other analysts note that Tesla already has competition in the space, particularly from Daimler, Volkswagen and even diesel truck stalwart Cummins. A Swedish company, Einride, has taken the EV truck to another level, eliminating the driver altogether in its prototype.Michael Harley, group managing editor for Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, says that Tesla would do well to focus “on short-haul, or last-mile, delivery which would benefit (the trucks with) regenerative breaking (which recharge batteries), low noise and emission-free EV motoring.”Tesla itself has to prove itself with the upcoming rollout of the Model 3 sedan, an entry-level vehicle that Musk has said remains in “production hell” as some 400,000 deposit holders wait for their cars to arrive sometime in 2018 or 2019.Musk’s company also has been hit with a range of lawsuits and complaints recently from workers who charge that Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., factories have been the site of racist and sexist behavior and anti-union crackdowns.Tesla has denied the charges, and said a recent space of layoffs were due to poor performance.Those issues aren't likely to be resolved soon or disappear. But Thursday the spotlight was on Musk as master showman pushing yet another industry's buttons with his insatiable and visionary drive.Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter. ",tesla,usatoday,,

",2017-11-02T00:00:00,"Evan Niu, CFA","PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:37ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported third-quarter earnings last night, and expectations were already muted heading into the release considering the company's big miss with Model 3 production that was previously disclosed. Beyond the headline figures that included its biggest quarterly loss ever ($671 million), the focus was expectedly on what the bottlenecks were and how Tesla is working to overcome them.Here are five important takeaways from the release and subsequent conference call.Pushing back the Model 3 ramp timelineThe most significant news was that Tesla is pushing back its production rate target of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week due to aforementioned bottlenecks. The company was previously hoping to hit that production rate by the end of 2017. Under ideal circumstances, Tesla could have then pumped out 20,000 Model 3 vehicles in December.Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 3, 2017Tesla is pushing back this timeline by a quarter, and now expects to hit the production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of Q1 2018. Tesla will provide more detail on its progress when it announces Q4 2017 deliveries in early January.Battery module production is the weakest linkSo far, the biggest bottleneck for Model 3 has been battery modules at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, in line with recent comments from Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga that suggested delays in automating the production process have hindered manufacturing but these bottlenecks would soon be solved.Tesla pinned the problems on a third-party manufacturing systems supplier that ""dropped the ball,"" according to CEO Elon Musk. As it is often wont to do, Tesla insourced the project and ""significantly redesigned"" that part of the module assembly line.Gross margin took a big hitOn a sequential basis, non-GAAP automotive gross margin fell from 25% to 18.7% due to a handful of factors, the first of which was increased Model 3 manufacturing costs that were spread over a small number of units since capacity utilization is extremely low for those production lines right now. Tesla also discounted inventory vehicles with discontinued trims (90 kWh packs) in order to move inventory, and the mix shifted toward the less profitable 75 kWh trims.Tesla is also trying to further differentiate the Model S from the Model 3, and made numerous features like Smart Air Suspension and dual-motor standard, which added to costs.More: Car buyers get bigger discounts in October despite strong auto salesMore: Tesla production snags delay Model 3 electric carThe China factoryTesla confirmed that it had inked a deal to build a factory in China, a few months after saying it was negotiating with the Chinese government. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that a deal had been reached.Capital spending related to this factory won't be meaningful until 2019, and Tesla's current goal is to commence local production in approximately three years in order to serve the Chinese market -- the largest electric vehicle market in the world -- as well as other markets in the region. Total production capacity is expected to be ""at least a couple hundred thousand"" vehicles per year.Considering Tesla's tendency to miss its deadlines, investors should probably adjust expectations to four to five years.About those mass firingsMusk chastised the media for covering the mass firings that have been creating some controversy for Tesla. The electric-car maker fired hundreds of employees earlier this month across both its automotive business as well as its SolarCity subsidiary, and attributed these terminations to annual performance reviews. There was some speculation that the firings could have impacted as many as 1,000 employees.Anecdotally, some employees claimed they had either not received recent reviews, or their reviews were positive, undermining Tesla's justification. It wasn't clear exactly how many employees were terminated, but Musk confirmed it was approximately 700, or 2% of Tesla's headcount.Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Tesla.

",2017-10-09T00:00:00,Anders Bylund,"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. The same goes for large businesses — putting all of your company's effort into a single product can lead to stagnation and stale ideas.Exploring new ideas is one way to keep your company relevant for the long haul, even if the side business doesn't have much to do with your main operations.You're about to see some examples of this from large household names in the American business world. We will explore some interesting side projects from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), IBM (NYSE: IBM), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). These ideas may grow into their breeches over time, but they look kind of crazy right now.Disney tackles roboticsYou've seen Disney robots at their theme parks -- animatronics have been a vital part of the Disneyland and Disney World experience for decades. But the House of Mouse didn't stop there.The company is not only advancing the state of the art in basic robotics, but also working out better ways to interact with computers and machines. Disney is building two-legged robots with the ability to walk on top of a ball, a swarm of robots with colored lights acting as pixels in a larger image, and human-like machines that could play catch with actual humans.More: Disney Parks: Halloween events without the screamsSome of these technologies will surely be used in future theme park attractions or in the movie studio, but that's not all. Look back at the ambitious Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow park, better known as EPCOT, for examples of Disney thinking far outside the theme park box, followed by the experimental community of Celebration, Florida. Those robots might find their way on regular city streets in the end.Alphabet wants to crack human agingThe company formerly known as Google still collects more than 99% of its quarterly revenue from that division's online search and advertising operations. That hasn't stopped Alphabet from pursuing a number of interesting side businesses, many of which hold serious promise in the far future.Among Alphabet's many side bets, the most interesting one is the medical research lab known as Calico.More: Alphabet's Project Loon gets OK to use balloons to revive Puerto Rico cell serviceCreated as a division of Google, and later of Alphabet, Calico wants to stop or slow human aging. This is done by a combination of traditional medical research and advanced data analysis. Calico is led by a crack team of medical scientists, and is quick to collaborate with other medical experts and research universities along the way. Futurist Ray Kurzweil, who hopes to achieve immortality for himself and others, is an advisor to Calico.Stop aging, heal any ailment, live forever. That's probably the most ambitious business idea I've ever seen.Tesla's energy hobby, soon to be the main businessWe know Tesla as a maker of fast, upscale electric cars. That's what pays the bills today and how the company got to where it is.But the company's ultimate plan is to become an energy company, and those electric cars are only a small piece of that long-term strategy. The Gigafactory is building batteries on a game-changing scale, and the SolarCity buyout added solar panel installations and Powerwall battery packs to Tesla's business operations.More: Could Puerto Rico go solar? Its governor said talks with Elon Musk about that went wellEnergy products accounted for just 12.5% of Tesla's total sales in the second quarter of 2017 and the growth rate is slowing down while Tesla shifts its focus from sales volume to profitability. That crazy side business is growing up in a hurry, and you won't think of Tesla as a pure car maker for much longer.Amazon, the traditional retailerThe e-commerce giant may have destroyed many old-school brick-and-mortar retailers over the years, but Amazon has also started to become one of those traditional ones recently.The biggest splash so far came with Amazon's buyout of Whole Foods Market, a nationwide chain of supermarkets with a focus on organic products. So Amazon is selling groceries in your neighborhood now, and will also use the store network to smooth out its deliveries and returns of other products. Whole Foods is a small cog in Amazon's much larger business machine, expected to generate roughly 9% of the combined company's total sales.IBM: The ultimate research labBig Blue is the undisputed king of innovation. In each of the last 24 years, IBM has been granted more U.S. patents than any other company. Most of these innovations are related to IBM's core operations, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. But it's almost impossible to produce 8,000 patents a year without touching some unusual ideas along the way.You'll find a few off-the-wall gems among IBM's recently granted patents:Patent No. US20170174343: Drone delivery of coffee based on a cognitive state of an individualPatent No. US9538335: Inferring device theft based on historical location dataPatent No. US20150002312: Method to mitigate honking of vehiclesSome of these interesting patents may eventually make their way into real business products and services while others become stepping stones toward learning larger lessons. Zoom out and you'll notice a data analysis link between the three examples above. Either way, this isn't exactly the enterprise computing stuff you thought IBM was made of.More: Follow USA TODAY Money and Tech on FacebookSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

",2017-09-28T00:00:00,Matthew Frankel,"Q: When I buy stocks, should I have a price target in mind where I'm willing to sell my shares and walk away?I'm not a fan of price targets, and I'll share a personal story of why.A couple of years after Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) initial public offering, I bought shares of the then-unproven company for just under $35. I said to myself, ""If the stock doubles, I'll sell."" Not long after I made my investment, the Tesla Model S shocked the world when it became Motor Trend magazine's Car of the Year in 2013, and the stock shot up so quickly that I didn't have time to sell at double my purchase price. I ended up unloading my shares for about $85 each.Today, Tesla stock is worth more than $370 per share. To say that I sold too soon would be an understatement.I learned the hard way that instead of setting a specific price target, it's far more important to ask yourself whether your reasons for initially buying the stock still apply, and if they do, whether the current share price is justified.In the case of my Tesla investment, not only did my initial reasons for buying still apply (game-changing automotive technology), but the company had gone from a niche player with the Tesla Roadster to a viable mass-market electric car manufacturer. Not only was the higher share price justified, but due to the success of the newly released Model S, the company's future looked brighter than ever.Price targets can be a useful tool in the context of ""I think Company X is really worth $50 per share, but it's trading for only $30.""

",2017-09-27T00:00:00,Dan Caplinger,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:002:38ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenNearly every investor has made bad mistakes with their portfolios, buying losing investments and missing out on explosive growth opportunities. Yet few mistakes can equal my experience with the cryptocurrency bitcoin. My skepticism about bitcoin is well documented, and the cryptocurrency's huge rise has given those who ignored my warnings and bought bitcoin in mid-2013 gains of roughly 4,000%.You'll never avoid mistakes, but you owe it to yourself to learn from them. I'd like to share three lessons I've learned from my experience with bitcoin, in the hopes that you can apply them to all of your investments — no matter what you prefer to hold in your portfolio.1. Prices can climb far further than you'd ever think possible.On looking at bitcoin in 2013, I thought that the meteoric rise that bitcoin had already enjoyed was almost unbelievable. Going from less than $0.01 to $100 in the span of just a few years was extremely impressive, especially in an environment in which bitcoin use was a lot more limited than it is today. Yet rising adoption of the cryptocurrency and increasing difficulty in mining bitcoin helped shift supply and demand to make prices rise, and we're still seeing the positive momentum continue even with bitcoin having gone well into four-digit prices.The same is true with a host of other investments. In the stock world, many have marveled at how Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) now has a market cap that exceeds those of major automakers with decades of experience and billions of dollars in sales. Yet a combination of investor demand and prospects for future gains have supported the share price, and the hope that Tesla's fundamental business performance will eventually catch up to its stock has given many shareholders the confidence to hold on to their shares and enjoy the big price gains they've seen.2. Enjoying big gains require suffering through big losses.Like lifelong stock investors have seen countless times, those who've profited the most from bitcoin have had to endure gut-wrenchingly big corrections. After climbing to $1,000 in 2013, bitcoin steadily lost ground, falling below $200 in 2015. Just this year, the gains and losses have been extremely volatile, with the rise to $3,000 immediately followed by a drop toward $2,000, and the recent push to nearly $5,000 followed by a decline back to just over $3,000.Many successful long-term stock stories are like that. In late 2011, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) saw its stock plunge as the company boosted prices for its DVD plans and announced that it would break the company in two, with the short-lived Qwikster concept to take the mail-order business while Netflix continued with streaming video. From those lows, Netflix has jumped in value by nearly 20 times, rewarding those who had the patience and commitment to stick with the stock during tough times.More: Can you live only on bitcoin? Some believers try itMore: Governments will close down cryptocurrencies if they get too big, warns Jamie DimonMore: No, bitcoin isn't going to replace gold as a safe haven investment3. Wall Street will inevitably look for ways to profit from winners.As bitcoin has grown in popularity, players in the financial world have sought to find ways to profit from it. The proliferation of cryptocurrency exchanges reflects the lack of regulation of bitcoin and its peers. Moreover, bitcoin-related funds like the Bitcoin Investment Trust (NASDAQOTH: GBTC) seek to give those who don't want to go to those exchanges an alternative way to get bitcoin exposure.Inevitably, vehicles for jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon come at a cost. In the case of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a 2% annual fee saps money from the fund steadily, and a large premium to the underlying value of the bitcoin that the fund holds risks major losses even if the price of bitcoin stays stable. Similar things have happened regularly with other popular investments, and investors simply need to understand that there are professionals trying to separate you from your money in many ways.I haven't gotten rich from bitcoin, but it has taught me some valuable lessons. By looking at your own investing track record, you can seek to learn from your mistakes and find ways to do better in the future.Dan Caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

",2017-04-24T00:00:00,Marco della Cava,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:08ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenSAN FRANCISCO — Tesla will double the number of charging locations available to owners of its 200,000 electric vehicles by the end of the year, the company announced in a blog post Monday.Since 2012, Tesla has built 5,400 Supercharger stations (expansive plazas that look like gas stations) and populated 9,000 hotels, restaurants and malls with wall-mounted Destination Charging connectors. By 2018, those numbers should hit 10,000 and 15,000 respectively.Although Tesla has Supercharger stations in 31 countries, U.S. owners stand to benefit most from the new charging stations."" In North America, we’ll increase the number of Superchargers by 150 percent, and in California alone we’ll add more than 1,000 Superchargers,"" the post reads. ""We’re moving full speed on site selection and many sites will soon enter construction to open in advance of the summer travel season.""Tesla's statement notes that priority will be given to the busiest routes trafficked by Tesla owners. In those corridors — which according to a map of proposed new stations include the Northeast and Pacific Northwest — Supercharger stations will be able to accommodate dozens of vehicles at a time. Charging time varies according to the model. Most owners recharge their vehicles overnight at home.In January, Tesla announced a change in charging fee policy. All cars built before Jan. 15 will continue to benefit from free access to Supercharger stations, even if the cars change hands in the future.But cars built after Jan. 15 will be eligible for an annual credit of roughly 1,000 miles of electric charge, after which owners will pay for an infusion of electrons. Tesla estimates that fill-ups for a trip from California to New York would cost around $120.Charging stations are considered critical to increasing public acceptance of electric vehicles, whose batteries limit driving range to an outer limit of 300 miles. That makes commuting in an EV a non-issue, but road trips become potentially worrisome.The distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco is around 400 miles, which is why Tesla has positioned a Supercharger station midway down the state.The expansion is timed to the imminent rollout of the Tesla Model 3 sedan, which with a base price of $30,000 costs a third of the automaker's loaded Model S and X vehicles. Production of the Model 3 is slated to begin this summer.CEO Elon Musk is pinning great hopes on the car, which if embraced by buyers could quintuple Tesla output to around 500,000 units a year.That sort of production could help assuage investor fears about profitability. Tesla is currently valued at $50 billion, a staggering number for a car company making around 100,000 cars a year.Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2017-04-11T00:00:00,The Editorial Board,"These days there is nothing particularly unusual about high-flying tech companies. They often take off like rockets, sometimes falling back to earth, but sometimes achieving lofty heights and reinventing whole industries.Thirteen years ago, for example, Facebook was a couple of guys in a dorm room. Today, its valuation of $404 billion is larger than the annual economic output of Thailand.But electric car maker Tesla, which briefly surpassed General Motors this week to become America’s most valuable auto company, brings something new to the conversation. No company has had to fight harder for the right to do business as has Tesla.Local dealerships benefit consumers: Opposing viewWhen Tesla introduced its pricey Model S in 2012, the company was banned in much of the country from selling its cars directly to consumers. Its business model called for cutting out the middleman, but state laws required it to go through entrenched networks of dealers.After years of litigating and legislating, Tesla has managed to eliminate, or get around, many of the laws. But it is still barred from opening sales and service centers in Texas, Michigan, Utah and Connecticut. Several other states, including New York and New Jersey, have placed caps on the number of centers it can have.Despite these restrictions, Tesla has made remarkable progress, if not yet profits. Its Model S has rivaled high-end cars offered by the likes of Mercedes Benz and BMW. And its $35,000 Model 3, is set to begin limited production later this year. Within a month of its unveiling it had received nearly 400,000 pre-orders.Its biggest accomplishment, however, has been its dogged and largely successful defense of free enterprise. Tesla has gotten as far as it has by doing what Detroit never did: challenging blatantly anti-competitive laws that states passed decades ago to protect auto dealers.When it started its battle, Tesla was in such a weak position that it was reduced to opening “galleries” instead of sales centers in many states. At these galleries customers could look at a Model S, touch it and sit in it — but not test drive or buy it.Over the next five years the company would fight a tenacious, state-by-state battle to get exceptions, exemptions and waivers allowing it to do business. Now it is going for all the marbles. A federal suit it filed in Michigan last fall challenges the constitutionally of state laws that mandate a role for middlemen in car sales. A win for Tesla could end many of the games dealers play with state legislatures. It might even spread beyond cars to other industries known for monetizing their political sway.At a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, Tesla (with 0.3% of the domestic auto market this year) might well be overvalued, as some stock analysts have suggested. Or perhaps GM (17.1% of the market) and Ford (15.2%) are undervalued.In any event, the main point is that Tesla has overcome substantial technological and political obstacles to get as far as it has. At a time when too many companies routinely abuse their customers, cook their books or use politicians to shield them from competition, it's enough to drive home renewed faith in capitalism.USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

",2017-02-28T00:00:00,Marco della Cava,"SAN FRANCISCO — A female Tesla employee who still works at the electric automaker contends in a lawsuit that she was discriminated against for being a woman, and then penalized when she complained to company officials.A.J. Vandermeyden, 33, filed the suit last fall, but her case surfaced Tuesday with the publication of an interview she gave to The Guardian.“It’s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have,"" she told the British publication.Vandermeyden claims that she was paid a lower salary, whistled at by male colleagues and found solutions to vehicle quality control issues but did not get promoted while male colleagues did.Those complaints echo claims of discriminatory workplace conditions at Uber leveled by former employee Susan Fowler, whose blog post on the matter has triggered both an investigation and a crisis at the ride hailing giant.They also come at a time when Tesla is facing workplace issue claims from factory worker Jose Moran, who has blogged about grueling working conditions at the company's Fremont, Calif., plant where $100,000 Model X and S sedans are built.CEO Elon Musk tweeted his belief that Moran was a paid agitator for the United Auto Workers union, which has been trying to unionize the factory, and called the charges ""morally outrageous.""Vandermeyden's attorney, Therese Lawless of Lawless & Lawless, told USA TODAY that her client's interview was conducted weeks ago and was not timed to appear shortly after Uber's sexual discrimination woes made news.""It's completely coincidental,"" said Lawless, who represented Ellen Pao in her unsuccessful 2015 discrimination suit again Silicon Valley investment firm Kleiner Perkins Caufied & Byers.""But interestingly, she’s getting a lot of support today,"" Lawless said. ""She’s moved into a different department (than the general assembly department). She loves the product. She tried to get it changed internally but couldn't. So she decided to do it from the outside.""Lawless said Vandermeyden, who joined Uber in 2013, is seeking a higher pay grade commensurate with her skills, back pay and damages for emotional distress. Lawless says Tesla is currently trying to move the case to binding arbitration based on signed employee forms that Lawless claims violate employee rights.""We're challenging Tesla's employee confidentiality agreement, which is very broad and says that employees can’t talk about anything they experience or see at Tesla,"" she says. ""It’s absurd. That's fine regarding trade secrets, but it's illegal to prohibit people from talking about working conditions for their pay.""Tesla shares third-party review In a statement provided to USA TODAY, Tesla said that Vandermeyden rose quickly in the company despite not having an engineering degree, from the paint shop to general assembly.""Even after she made her complaints of alleged discrimination, she sought and was advanced into at least one other new role,"" the statement said, adding that when Vandermeyden raised her concerns about the workplace the company hired a ""neutral third party"" to investigate the claims.""After an exhaustive review of the facts, the independent investigator determined that Ms. Vandermeyden’s 'claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation have not been substantiated,' (and) without this context, the story presented in the (Guardian) article is misleading,"" the statement concluded.Tesla provided USA TODAY with a redacted version of the findings from what it describes as its neutral third party, Anne Hilbert of EMC2Law, for the purpose of summarizing its findings.According to Hilbert, Vandermeyden was in the middle of her peer group's pay scale, promotions of male peers were not due to gender discrimination, and the catcalls from assembly line colleagues were more insensitive than sexist.While the outcome of Vandermeyden's workplace suit won't be known for some time, it highlights what is far from a new issue in Silicon Valley.Tech firms are known for a hard-charging culture; Musk himself has bragged about laying out a sleeping bag at the end of the Tesla assembly line.

",2017-02-03T00:00:00,Marco della Cava,"SAN FRANCISCO — On Friday, Elon Musk completed a journey almost as improbable as his vaunted quest for Mars.In attending President Trump’s first business advisory council meeting, the South African-born, self-made billionaire who is bent on saving the world from global warming became counselor to a New York real estate mogul and U.S. president who is eager to bring back the age of coal.Although the purpose of the council is in Musk's wheelhouse — Trump convened more than a dozen top CEOs to talk about growing business opportunities and reducing regulations — the accepted invitation had Musk-watchers scratching their heads. He had not supported candidate Trump.“Elon has always been very opportunistic,” says Ashlee Vance, whose Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future chronicles the entrepreneur’s driven path from Africa to Canada to the U.S. “But still, this is weird.”The opportunities are many, as are the risks.As chief executive officer of companies that compete in the heavily regulated arenas of aerospace (SpaceX), automotive (Tesla) and energy (SolarCity), Musk, 45, can try and parlay his Trump connection into smoothing regulatory bumps and accessing federal funding as he expands his ventures.What Elon Musk stands to gain and lose with TrumpUber CEO quits Trump's economic advisory councilIn particular, Musk would appear to be on the brink of bringing sleek electric cars to the masses with his entry-level Model 3 sedan, whose success is key to Tesla becoming profitable and justifying the steep run in its shares (TSLA).He's also hoping to start an alt-energy revolution with a SolarCity acquisition that could find him peddling affordable solar panels and electricity storage devices, an ambition that would benefit from policies like a carbon tax that penalizes fossil fuel generation.Trump, in turn, gets to associate himself with an industry maverick — a disruptor like the political outsider the president has styled himself — who is opening factories and expanding U.S.-based jobs. Musk's SolarCity and Tesla efforts are slated to employs tens of thousands in factories on both coasts.Make or break time for Musk and his companiesBut plenty of pitfalls exist for Musk as he tries to navigate these political waters.While Trump may personally find himself drawn to a CEO who likes to speak and tweet in declarative statements — Musk once blasted Apple as a “graveyard” for failed Tesla engineers — the president is surrounded by powerful counselors who may have the final word.Last week’s seven nation majority-Muslim immigration ban, which extended even to green card holders and prompted protests nationwide, was the work of advisors Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, according to Newsweek. That suggests they or others could steer Trump clear of pro-Tesla or SpaceX decisions should they determine them to be not in the best interests of Trump's base.Musk may appeal to Trump’s professed love of American ingenuity, but Tesla and SolarCity have an elitist sheen that could spell disaster. Trump appears to be clearing the way for less regulation in the oil and gas industries, which wouldn’t be a boon to an electricity enthusiast.What’s more, if anything happened to today’s federal tax incentives on electric cars, Musk could find that his wares cost $7,500 more overnight, no small matter on the $35,000 Model 3.And another potential pothole looms for Musk, one that’s already dinged another tech company in talks with the White House.Uber's lessonIn agreeing to broadly advise the new administration — Musk is on Friday’s Strategy and Policy Forum council along with CEOs from Pepsi, General Motors and JP MorganChase, as well as on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative committee— there exists the potential brand blowback that Uber experienced this week.When New York taxis last weekend stopped operating to support protesters at JFK over Trump's Muslim immigration ban,  Uber continued to operate. That stand created a backlash on social media named #deleteUber, and competitor Lyft saw its app overtake Uber on the Apple App Store.Google employees stage worldwide walkout over Trump edictUber CEO Travis Kalanick also came under fire from drivers, who urged him to quit his position on Trump's advisory council. On Thursday afternoon, Kalanick did just that.Although Tesla stock is up nearly 40% since December, the company did start to see some consumers canceling their $1,000 deposits for the company’s upcoming entry-level Model 3 sedan, according to auto site Electrek.“Kills me as a TSLA fan but need to take a stand,” tweeted Colin Niloc, who decided to donate his deposit to charity.Better to have a seat at the tableMusk came out against the controversial immigration ban on Twitter in relatively muted language and suggested that his 7 million followers use him as a vehicle for change. “Please read immigration order. Lmk (let me know) specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President,” he tweeted.That didn't mollify some tech leaders. Facebook's head of artificial intelligence tweeted at Musk in blunt terms: “You are an advisor to Trump. Quit. If you stay, fight and know that this will hurt your legacy regardless.”Musk has maintained that participating with the new administration will yield better results than a battle.In a tweeted message late Thursday, Musk said he would remain on the Trump business council and use it as an opportunity to raise objections to the recent immigration policy.""I understand the perspective of those who object to my attending this meeting, but I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good,” he wrote.The CEO also said he would bring up the immigration ban and the business-focused gathering. Former GE CEO Jack Welch told CNBC that Musk did bring up the topic and that it was discussed by the group. Musk tweeted Friday night that ""there has already been and there will be progress on this matter,"" and he pointed to changes for green card holders. ""Work & spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon,"" he tweeted.Musk biographer Vance says that despite the liberal nature of Tesla’s green energy agenda, the boss ultimately knows that reaching his business goals — whether ridding the planet of carbon monoxide emissions or colonizing Mars — is integral to that personal legacy.Report: Apple CEO wants White House to reconsider immigration order“Elon is always the underdog, which means he’s in self-preservation mode with his companies,” says Vance, who notes that despite Musk’s outsized personality (another similarity to the 45th president) the success of his companies is by no means guaranteed.For instance, SolarCity is battling energy companies that are deep-pocketed donors of Congressional leaders. In aerospace, SpaceX is fighting the entrenched practice of the U.S. awarding aerospace contracts to the Lockheed Martin and Boeing partnership.In his access to Trump and Trump adviser Peter Thiel, who like Musk made a fortune starting PayPal, Musk has a chance to get the new administration on his side. But it's not a given the gambit will win.Thiel told The New York Times: “They’re both grandmaster-level salespeople and these two very much larger-than-life figures.”Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.",tesla,usatoday,,

And he has a plan.Billionaire innovator Elon Musk declared early Wednesday that he's ready to move ahead with his recently formulated ambitions to bore holes, possibly under the city.""Exciting progress on the tunnel front,"" Musk tweeted. ""Plan to start digging in a month or so.""Digging just where and how, no one knows. Coming from anyone else, such a declaration might brushed off as a joke.But given that Musk is the entrepreneur who, with a team, reshaped mobile payments (PayPal), sent rockets into space (Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX) and launched an electric-car company (Tesla Motors), the tweets are unlikely to be dismissed. He is, after all, being taken seriously about a possible Mars mission.And the tunneling industry is shoveling up a lot of work these days with expectations of growing revenue at an annualized rate of 7.3% from 2016 through 2021, rising to $5.6 billion, according to research firm IBISWorld.Government investments are key drivers of the growth, representing about 69.5% of industry revenue. In Los Angeles, for instance, there are plenty of tunneling projects are part of an expansion of subway and light rail lines. Major companies in the tunneling business include San Francisco-based Bechtel Group and Omaha, Neb.-based Kiewit Corp., with market share of 4.1% and 2.4%, respectively, according to IBISWorld.Musk first mentioned his boring plans in December. ""Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging,"" he tweeted at the time, adding, ""it shall be called 'The Boring Company.'""""Boring,"" he said, apparently coining a catchphrase, ""it's what we do.""Next big thing from Elon Musk? It could be 'boring'To remove all doubt — OK, to remove some doubt — he added, ""I am actually going to do this.""In classic Musk fashion, on Wednesday he teased the forthcoming announcement with just enough detail to make you ponder the possibilities.""Where will your tunnel be?"" a Twitter user asked.""Starting across from my desk at SpaceX,"" he responded. ""Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX."" Crenshaw Boulevard is a major north-south street in greater Los Angeles, not far from SpaceX's headquarters in the suburb of Hawthorne.Musk's tunnel plans face a few, shall we say, bureaucratic hurdles, however.For starters, the permitting process alone can be nightmare. A spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Public Works did not respond to requests seeking comment. A spokesman for the nearby Los Angeles International Airport declined to comment.The consumer watchdog organization U.S. Public Interest Research Group last year dubbed the longstanding attempt at an underground extension of the Long Beach Freeway through San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles County one of the biggest transportation ""boondoggles"" in the country. The $3.2 billion to $5.6 billion project is the ""most expensive, most polluting and least effective option for addressing the area’s transportation problems,"" the group said.Make no mistake, though: Musk has good timing. After meeting with President Trump on Monday to promote American manufacturing and praising Trump's secretary of State nominee Tuesday, he renewed speculation about his tunnel ambitions just in time for the president's infrastructure spending push.A ""large investment tunneling project"" like Musk's or the Hudson River rail tunnel project connecting New Jersey to New York ""could be considered"" as part of the Trump administration's infrastructure spending, International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association communications director Bill Cramer said in an email.""In general, the nation’s infrastructure is crumbling,"" Cramer said. ""There simply is not enough federal, state and local government funding to address all of the nation’s infrastructure needs.

The Nasdaq, typically looked at being more speculative due to its reliance on tech and biotech, is already up 3.5% this year. That almost makes the broad S&P 500 look like it’s sitting still with a 1.6% gain.Tech stocks have some financial attributes making them winners from changes expected this year. ""Although it took the Nasdaq a bit longer to participate in the Trump jump, the outlook has done a 180 from fear to seeing the amazing opportunity for Tech firms particularly,"" says Joe Kinahan, strategist at TD Ameritrade.The Nasdaq's awakening has been somewhat pronounced this year. Over the past twelve months, the Nasdaq had been performing just about in-line with the Dow Jones industrial average. The Nasdaq is up 23.2% the past 12 months, which is nose-to-nose with the Dow's 23.1% increase during the same period. But now, the Nasdaq is luring attention from investors for a number of reasons, including:* A boost from a weakening U.S. dollar. The price of the U.S. dollar has weakened this year, sliding roughly 1% against the euro and 2% versus the yen, according to data from Oanda. A weak dollar is a potential victory for technology companies since they get a higher percentage of their revenue from overseas than any of the 11 industry sectors, says Sam Stovall, strategist at research firm CFRA. When technology firms bring overseas profits back to the U.S., profits are worth more in U.S. dollars once the currency is translated.* Strong performance by key stocks. Amazon and Facebook, two of the most valuable stocks in the Nasdaq, are having a good year. Facebook shares are up 11.6% this year - the best performance of any tech stock - and up nearly 35% over the past twelve months. Amazon shares are up 9% this year and have risen 40% over the past 12 months. Such big gains from these two stocks are important since they have the fourth and fifth largest weightings in the index. But the strength runs deeper, still. All five of the most valuable stocks in the Nasdaq, including Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are all up this year and have gained an average of 2.8%.* Broadening outside of tech. The massive market values of the tech giants put them in control of the Nasdaq. But when stocks outside of tech also participate, that lends extra power to the Nasdaq's rally. That's been the case this year, all five of the best performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 are outside the technology sector. Three of the best stocks are healthcare stocks, including genetic analyst Illumina (ILMN), cancer treatment developer Incyte (INCY) and biotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). The other best Nasdaq stocks this year are consumer discretionary companies, cable operator Liberty Global (LBTYA) and online travel agent TripAdvisor (TRIP), which are up more than 14%.Stocks swoon on Trump remarks; Nasdaq at new highBut while some are excited by the big Nasdaq gains, others express caution. ""I think it has run too far too fast,"" Stovall says. Expect some Nasdaq choppiness as investors endure political battles. ""(Tech stocks) have good profit margins and will be among the immediate beneficiaries of the Trumpconomic Brave New Capitalistic World,"" says Michael Farr, CEO of money manager Farr, Miller & Washington.

This time it blamed ""short-term challenges starting at the end of October and lasting through early December"" due to the addition of new hardware for its Autopilot partial self-driving system, which pushed more vehicle production towards the end of the year than had been planned, company officials said in a statement.Fiat Chrysler to show off Android auto system at CESFord will have a 300-mile range electric SUV by 2020Tesla (TSLA) shares closed up 1.5% Tuesday at $216.99, but then dropped 2% in after hours trading.The Palo Alto, Calif-based company actually hit its target when one considers the number of vehicles it produced. Tesla built 24,882 vehicles in the fourth quarter, resulting in total 2016 production of 83,922 vehicles, an increase of 64% from 2015.Tesla said that nearly 3,000 cars that were out for delivery in the fourth quarter didn't make it into the hands of customers either due to transportation snags or a buyer's inability to take delivery. Nearly 7,000 cars other started their journey to buyers in the quarter, and will be counted as sales in the current quarter.In the last three months of 2016, Tesla's net orders for Model S and X were 52% higher than the year before and 24%, officials said.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has vowed to take Tesla from being a builder of luxury, six-figure cars packed with technology to a more mass market electric vehicle manufacturer thanks to the forthcoming Model 3 sedan. Tesla continues to innovate and add technology into its vehicles.Starting at around $35,000, the Model 3 has piqued the interest of many buyers. Nearly 400,000 people have plunked down $1,000 deposits.On New Year's Eve, Musk activated a new level of self-driving features for 1,000 owners.Musk has a busy 2017 ahead. Not only is he juggling a $1 billion Gigafactory build-out in Nevada, but he's also busy folding recently purchased SolarCity into the Tesla portfolio, in addition to running rocket company SpaceX.Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2016-12-16T00:00:00,Matt Krantz,"You just pretty much needed to own stocks in 2016 to make money. Don't expect such an easy time in 2017 as the market braces for changes that could shake things up.Practically anything with a ticker symbol rose in 2016. It was just a matter of by how much. With just one more trading day left before the New Year, owning the Standard & Poor's 500 index has delivered investors an 10.1% gain. Holding small companies has been even better, with the Russell 2000 index up 20%.► MORE:'Game changer' Trump | Rally rolls on? | Themes | Rates' roleBut the days of easy stock gains are over as the market prepares for big changes, according to experts tapped in the 2017 USA TODAY Investment Roundtable. Higher interest rates, massive investments moving to corporate cloud computing and important bets on new forms of transportation and advanced manufacturing are just a few of the important shifts investors need to be prepared for. That's why our gurus think investors will find the best success with the following playbook and they name names.Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager T. Rowe Price U.S. Large-Cap Core Fund ► AutoZone, AZO: Close as of Thursday, Dec. 29: $798.49. Sells automotive replacement parts from more than 5,000 stores in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil.Why he likes it: AutoZone has steadily increased its earnings per share and sales at stores open at least a year and has also been buying back stock. AutoZone is trading for 14 times expected earnings in 2018, making it an attractive relative value especially if tax rates come down. The company also has limited competition as it's the ""industry that's largely consolidated amongst two big guys"" including Advance Auto Parts (AAP).► Amazon, AMZN: Thursday's close $765.15. The USA's biggest online retailer also has a fast-growing business of selling computer capabilities to other companies.Why he likes it: While it might seem Amazon has a firm grip on online shopping, T. Rowe Price estimates that it only has a 3% share of the entire future e-commerce market. A big piece of growth comes from its Amazon Web Services business, where Amazon rents out computing capability to other companies for a fee. This could be a dramatically larger opportunity as more businesses shift their technology to the cloud. ""Talk about disruption, this is a disruptive company going after two of the largest end market opportunities that we see,"" namely online retail and cloud services, he says.► JP Morgan Chase, JPM: Thursday's close $85.89. The most valuable U.S. bank by market value with community banking, investment banking and asset management operations.Why he likes it: The management team continues to show an ability to boost returns. That strong management could be even more successful if there are benefits for financial firms in terms of tax reform or lower regulation. Specifically, any new regulation that lowers the amount of capital banks must keep could boost profitability. ""It's the highest quality bank in the market,"" he says.► Visa, V: Thursday's close $78.33. Visa is a global leader in payment systems and it gives merchants the ability to be paid online or in physical locations.Why he likes it: Visa is a classic example of a ""secular growth"" stock, in other words, a company that could benefit no matter what happens with the global economy. Only 20% of global payments are electronic, a percentage that will increase as more consumers turn away from the inconveniences of cash. Growth will only continue in 2017 as Visa integrates its acquisition of Visa's European operations. ""There's a lot of room to run here,"" he says.► American Tower, AMT. Thursday's close $106.39. A real-estate investment trust that focuses on leasing communication locations to wireless service providers.Why he likes it: The company has long-term contracts with wireless telecom companies, which offers stable returns. The company has been steadily increasing its cash flow and benefits from its corporate structure from a tax perspective. The company's dividend has increased by 20% a year.Rupal Bhansali, chief investment officer of international and global equities at Ariel Investments► Gilead Sciences, GILD. Thursday's close $72.13. A biotechnology company working on treatments and cures for a variety of diseases ranging from liver malfunctions to HIV and hepatitis.Why she likes it:  The stock is ""dirt cheap"" as it has been sold off, she says. The company generates ""ridiculous amounts"" of cash flow, so much so it could buy back the entire company in five years at the current rate. The company's big promise is that it's not just working on drugs to improve conditions, but rather, to cure them. Justifying a high drug price is easier when selling a cure.  ""Companies that create value will be able to charge for that. And they are curing a disease. That's the Holy Grail of medicine,"" she says.► Nokia (ADR), NOK. Thursday's close $4.83. A seller of wireless networking infrastructure equipment and mobile Internet gear.Why she likes it: Growing demand for mobile data is a boon for Nokia, which is one of the biggest left of a ""handful"" of players that have largely merged with each other. While there is a ""lull"" in investment in mobile data infrastructure technology, since there was a big wave of investment already, demand will increase as mobile workers and consumers demand access to information from anywhere. The stock has fallen this year, but ""if you are patient, as we are, you can look forward to the next wave that will ensue inevitably,"" she says.► China Mobile (ADR): CHL. Thursday's close $52.53.  A leading provider of mobile telecom services in mainland China and Hong Kong.Why she likes it: China Mobile is already larger than Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile combined. It has 66% market share in China with 800 million subscribers. Currently, customers in China are only paying about $10 a month for telecom services, versus $60 in the U.S. Expect Chinese consumers to demand faster speeds and more data, which will likely boost the amount they're willing to pay. Chinese consumers are still shifting to smartphones which will increase demands for data telecom services. ""In China, you're still migrating towards smartphone penetration. So that's another opportunity,"" she says.► Telefonica Deutschland: DB:O2D. Thursday's close 4.08. A telecommunication service in Germany that offers wireless and hardwired communications services to consumers and businesses.Why she likes it: European regulators have been more permissive about mergers in the industry, which is a potential win for this major company. In the U.S., there are four major wireless carriers for a population roughly equal to Europe. Yet, in Europe, each country has three of four telecom players. ""It is a market that is crying for market consolidation,"" she says. With fewer companies, prices for telecom services should rise. Currently, consumers can get a decent wireless plan for 5 euros, which could rise if there are fewer competitors and consumers use wireless more.► GlaxoSmithKline (ADR): GSK. Thursday's close $38.44. A U.K.-based maker of medical treatments including vaccines and anti-viral products.Why she likes it: This is a health care company that has both a solid dividend yield (5%) but also growth opportunities. The company is finding its footing with new drugs that are ""trending well"" in the market. New management in the unit of the company that manages consumer products such as Tums, Flonase and Sensodyne has been successful. Currently, the company only keeps 10 cents on the dollar after paying operating costs, but that could increase to 15 cents to  20 cents.Gavin Baker, portfolio manager at Fidelity OTC Fund► Alphabet: GOOGL. Thursday's close $802.88. A leading online advertising company with interests in mobile technology, cloud software and the Google search engine.Why he likes it:  The company's large database on consumer behavior used for online advertising paired with viewing consumption on YouTube and its mobile technology allow it to be a winner in the artificial intelligence era. The company's hand with the Android mobile operating system also puts it in a position of strength. ""If anyone is going to bring us the Star Trek computer which can answer any question or do any task ... I think it's Google,"" he says.► Activision Blizzard: ATVI. Thursday's close $36.48. A top publisher of video games for computers, video game consoles and mobile including titles like Candy Crush Saga and Call of Duty.Why he likes it: Video-game companies are winning as technology used in gaming devices continues to improve. Video game companies' ability to sell directly to consumers with app stores and downloads — rather through physical retailers — boosts profitability and allows them to sell add-on features over time to extend the lure of the game. Electronic sports competitions draw many gamers and customers who want to watch the professionals play. Games like ""Call of Duty, Overwatch and Battlefield are the new NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball,"" he says. Call of Duty and Overwatch are both published by Activision, while Battlefield is owned by Electronic Arts.► Ubisoft Entertainment: ENXTPA: UBI. Thursday's close 33.87. French video game publisher of titles ranging from Far Cry to Assassin's Creed.Why he likes it: The company has been trying to launch more titles to get beyond its biggest sellers and has introduced new properties like Watchdogs and The Division. ""They've suffered from introducing all these new franchises. Now they're moving into a phase where they're very focused on digital,"" he says.► Chipotle Mexican Grill: CMG. Thursday's close $376.61. A fast-casual Mexican food chain operating more than 2,000 locations.Why he likes it: The company's stock and customer traffic have taken a hit following food safety scares. But those concerns will pass, as has been the case with other restaurants. ""Lots of restaurants all over the world have been through food safety scares, and there's a very predictable pattern for how they ... recover,"" he says. Adjusted for stock buybacks, the company's peak profit was $21 a share in the 12 months ended in the third quarter of 2015. Now the company is earning about $3 a share annually. Profits are hurt by investments in food safety and lower customer visits. But Baker is looking for better digital marketing and mobile payments to boost results.► Tesla: TSLA. Thursday's close $214.68. A seller of electric cars as well as power storage devices and solar generation equipment.Why he likes it: Tesla is often seen as just an electric car company, but ""it's just the world's best car company,"" he says. Tesla competes with BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Porsche and Audi for luxury car buyers and has the top market share in that segment in the U.S., he says. Tesla's Model S, a four-year-old car, sold better than the new BMW 7 Series by two to one, he says. Tesla's cars are also designed so users can upgrade them, for instance, once self-driving cars become approved, he says. New models will have lower price points, making it a choice for lower-end markets.Footnote: These are not recommendations to buy or sell, but rather, top stocks that Baker owned in the Fidelity OTC fund as of Oct. 31, 2016.David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs► Bank of America: BAC. Thursday's close $22.00. A global U.S.-based bank with consumer banking, wealth management, global market and other services.Why he likes it: Of all the U.S. banks, Bank of America is the most exposed to interest rates, so will benefit most from rising interest rates, Kostin says. The bank is also focused on reducing corporate spending and ""would be a big beneficiary of reduced financial regulation,"" he says.► Discover Financial Services: DFS.  Thursday's close $71.85. A banking and payments service based in the U.S. that offers credit cards as well as student loans and banking products.Why he likes it: Discover is another example of a bank that could benefit disproportionately from higher interest rates. Meanwhile, the company's relatively high 37% tax rate puts it in a good position to benefit from any coming cut in the corporate tax rate with the new president. Goldman thinks the stock could be worth $75 a share.► Alphabet. (also recommended by Baker)Why he likes it: Advertising revenue at the company is growing at 18% a year, as searches on mobile devices grow. The company's cloud computing business - where companies rent computing space - is also growing rapidly and is profitable. The new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat is also bringing more spending discipline to the company. Meanwhile, other benefits could be a reduction on taxes for foreign profits brought back to the U.S., which could be positive for investors if the company uses some of that cash to buy back stock.► Netflix: NFLX. Thursday's close $125.33. The company streams video content such as movies and TV shows to subscribers in the U.S. and internationally.Why he likes it: Netflix has already been growing by 25% a year as more consumers shift their video viewing to the online service. ""It's a ... shift of the way people consume media and watch television,"" he says. The company has also spent heavily to create its own unique content that can't be found on competing networks. The risk is that Netflix is hardly an undiscovered stock and is pricey.► Costco: COST. Thursday's close $161.13. Operates retail warehouses with both branded and private-label products in groceries, electronics, apparel and other categories.Why he likes it: Given the President-elect's focus on boosting U.S. growth rates, Goldman Sachs is focused on U.S.-centric companies. ""About 73% of the revenue (are from) here domestically,"" he says. The company should also be able to start boosting the membership fees it charges customers. Costco also has less sensitivity to rising labor costs than some of its competition. Goldman sees the stock worth $186 a share in the next 12 months.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2016-11-17T00:00:00,Marco della Cava,"SAN FRANCISCO —In a deal that brings electric cars together with solar power, Tesla Motors shareholders voted Thursday to approve a deal to acquire SolarCity.The acquisition makes SolarCity, which is the nation's largest manufacturer and installer of solar panels, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla. More than 85% of shares voted were cast in favor of the acquisition.Tesla (TSLA) shares, which closed up 2.5% at $188.66, rose 1.4% in after hours trading. SolarCity (SCTY) shares rose 2.5% after hours to $20.90.In adding SolarCity to the portfolio, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Tesla stores would become one-stop shopping emporiums where consumers can purchase solar panels, electricity storage units called Powerwalls and Powerpacks, and a growing suite of electric vehicles.""We’re trying to make an integrated product, where you can go to Tesla store and just say yes,"" Musk said after the vote. ""It's seamless and you love it.""Jaguar could scare Tesla with electric I-Pace SUV conceptMusk added that the company expects to begin producing its new solar panels ""in volume in the summer of next year, but the important thing is the apples-to-apples comparison to a regular roof."" He said SolarCity panels could be priced at, or even slightly below, that of a regular roof, ""and the electricity is just a bonus.""Traditional solar panels stand out significantly visually on rooftops -- shiny, bulky black panels that aren't necessarily appealing to the eye. Musk's vision involves creating solar panels disguised as shingle or tiles that seamlessly integrate into a roof.When Musk first announced his intention to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion back in August, it was met with some scrutiny. Musk was SolarCity's largest shareholder and the acquisition seemed like a conflict of interest, especially given that SolarCity's founder, Lyndon Rive, is Musk's cousin.What's more, some shareholders and analysts questioned whether taking on a mission to get Tesla into the home solar panel market was wise given the challenges facing the company's automotive division. While Tesla's sleek cars have quickly become status symbols, questions remain about the company's profitability as well as its ability to grapple with production snags.Musk has repeatedly stated that Tesla is on the cusp of vaulting from a maker of niche high-end electric vehicles — its $100,000 Model S and X sedans — to a builder of more mass-market EVs thanks to its forthcoming Model 3 sedan.Plus, he has an expansive vision: Musk has an ever-expanding vision for his companies, which include SpaceX, a rocketry startup that intends to colonize Mars.Elon Musk to ramp up Tesla's critical battery GigafactoryThe company plans to increase production tenfold to 500,000 units once the Model 3 comes on line, and it is in the process of building out a massive Gigafactory in the desert east of Reno, Nev., for the purpose of building both battery cells and, eventually, vehicles. The idea is that once Tesla can make its products at scale, profits will follow.Thursday's shareholder meeting took place at Tesla's main automotive plant in Fremont, just east of San Francisco.The deal seemed to get a boost recently when it got the endorsement of Institutional Shareholder Services, an advisory firm whose recommendations are often followed by major shareholders in contentious votes.While the future of solar has yet to take off despite government subsidies and the opportunity for homeowners to sell power back to the grid, Musk is convinced that there are inefficiencies in the system that his company can exploit to help grow the market.""Assuming we can make a solar roof cost less than a normal roof, then subsidies no longer matter,"" said Musk.Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2016-10-28T00:00:00,Matt Krantz,"Q: Why are 'hot stocks' cooling off?A: It's hard to blame investors who thought picking stocks was easy. After all, investors just needed to buy shares in popular growth stocks like restaurant Chipotle (CMG), electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), apparel maker Under Armour (UA) and maybe a hot alternative energy play like First Solar (FSLR) and watch the money roll in during 2015.The game has changed dramatically this year. Shares of Chipotle are down more than 25% in 2016 amid plunging revenue and profit. Tesla shares are down this year, too, although a surprise profit reported late Wednesday will trim the losses. Under Armour and First Solar skyrocketed 19% and 48%, respectively in 2015. This year, though, they are down 21% and 38%.The underperformance of these ""growth"" stocks is completely predictable, it turns out. Growth stocks, those that trade at the highest prices compared to their net worth or book value, wind up being poor performers relative to how risky they are. The Index Funds Advisor Large Growth index, which contains popular and expensive stocks, has generated a long-term average annual gain of 9.1%. That's below the 9.7% average annual gain by the Standard & Poor's 500. But it gets worse. Large growth stocks are 17% riskier than the S&P 500, so you're getting a lower return and more risk. That's a bad tradeoff.USA TODAY markets reporter Matt Krantz answers a different reader question twice a week.

",2016-10-27T00:00:00,Adam Shell,"Stocks closed modestly lower Thursday despite upbeat earnings reports from companies in tech, automotive and health care.The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 29.65 points, or 0.16%, to 18,169.68. The Dow has now gone 12 sessions without a closing change of 100 points or more, its quietest stretch since going 15 trading days in July and August without a triple-digit move.The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 6.39 points, 0.30%, to 2133.04, and the Nasdaq composite was off 0.65%, or 34.29 points, to 5215.97.Third-quarter earnings reports were again the main market driver.

",2016-11-14T00:00:00,Beth McKenna,"Investors can often find big stock winners by looking for companies that are expanding revenue at a fast clip. Strong sales growth is usually a forerunner of strong earnings and cash flow growth, which in turn drives stock prices. That said, strong revenue growth alone doesn't mean that profits will follow.It's easy to find companies with actual and/or projected robust revenue growth, but many of them are tiny, have never been profitable, and don't have positive earnings or cash flow anywhere in sight. Two companies that are more established are Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB). CompanyMarket Cap 2016 Projected Revenue Growth (YOY)2017 Projected Revenue Growth (YOY)Projected Revenue Growth From 2015 Through 2017Profitability Status (TTM)Tesla Motors $30.3 billion 22.5% 43.9% 76.4%Not profitable on a TTM basis, but just posted positive EPS for Q3. Facebook  $376.3 billion 51.5% 35.1% 104.7%Currently profitable.Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data to Oct. 26. YOY = year over year. TTM = trailing 12 months.TeslaElectric-vehicle maker Tesla Motors' revenue has soared since the company went public in 2009, thanks to the success of its luxury Model S sedan and Model X crossover vehicles, which began being delivered to customers in mid-2012 and late 2015, respectively. Tesla's more affordable Model 3 sedan, with deliveries scheduled to begin in late 2017, could significantly rev up revenue growth.The bulk of Tesla's revenue currently comes from sales of its EVs, but that could change over time as its nascent energy storage business grows. Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk's plans to disrupt the energy industry by providing complete renewable energy systems for residential, commercial, and industrial customers by coupling Tesla's stationary storage lithium-ion battery packs with sister company SolarCity's(NASDAQ: SCTY) solar panels. Those lithium-ion battery packs, which will also be used to produce the Model 3, will be manufactured at Tesla's ""Gigafactory"" once it's up and running.SolarCity will likely move beyond being a sister company next month, as Tesla is in the process of acquiring the company run by Musk's cousin in an all-stock deal. On Nov. 1, Musk will provide a strategic and financial update on the deal, which will then go to a shareholder vote on Nov. 17.Analysts expect Tesla's year-over-year revenue to increase 22.5% to $6.48 billion in 2016 followed by a 43.9% jump to $9.33 billion in 2017, which equates to 76.4% revenue growth in the two-year period from 2015 through 2017. No, 76.4% is not a doubling of revenue. The potential doubling of revenue occurs from now -- so through late 2018. Tesla's year-over-year revenue growth should accelerate in 2018 because the Model 3 should begin rolling out in at least decent numbers sometime during the year, unless Tesla's quite behind plan, which is possible. (Revenue, of course, will get an even bigger boost if the SolarCity deal goes through.)Analysts aren't projecting that Tesla will be profitable through 2017. And given the likely Solar City deal and Musk's endless ambitions, profitability could be quite a way down the (electric) road. However, it's worth noting that Tesla just this week posted a surprise profit for the third quarter. So the core business does have the potential to be profitable. It's simply that money will almost surely be plowed back in for quite a while to fuel Musk's long-term vision.FacebookLike Tesla, social-networking phenomenon Facebook has posted scorching revenue growth since going public, which in its case was in 2012. It also shares some other key traits with Tesla: It was founded and is run by a leader -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- whom many believe to be a visionary, and its revenue growth is projected to stay in go-go mode for at least the near term.Tesla is the better company or societal force for good, in my view. It's disrupting an industry not only tied to global warming, but also delivering core products that I believe truly benefit consumers. While Facebook has some valuable uses, at core, it's an outlet for broad and deep ad mining. As an investment, however, Facebook is probably a much safer bet than Tesla for most investors. Zuckerberg together with Chief Operating Officer Cheryl Sandberg, has been doing a great job running the company -- and, unlike Tesla, it's already very profitable.Analysts expect Facebook's year-over-year revenue to soar 51.5% to $27.15 billion in 2016, followed by a 35.10% jump to $36.7 billion in 2017, which equates to scorching 104.7% revenue growth in the two-year period from 2015 through 2017. Moreover, Facebook has enough growth potential in its core business as well as in its other platforms -- WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram -- to keep the revenue growth party going for some time, assuming folks don't tire of its offerings or it doesn't get disrupted. (Neither of these things is likely to happen through the intermediate term, in my view.)  In the second quarter, Facebook's monthly active users increased 15% year over year to 1.71 billion, while WhatsApp and Messenger both had over 1 billion monthly active users, and Instagram had more than 500 million MAUs.Ad-based businesses in general can be extremely lucrative when done right. (Think Alphabet's Google.) And, in fact, Facebook became profitable very early on after its IPO. It turned the corner to profitability in the fourth quarter of 2012 and its profitability has since soared. Its profit margin for the trailing 12 months is a fat 27.2%. To put that in context, Google's trailing-12-month profit margin is 22%. Moreover, Facebook is also a cash cow that generates amazing cash flows. Cash is especially king in the tech industries because it allows companies to buy other companies and pour money into long-term growth initiatives.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/08/03/how-biofuels-will-expand-teslas-charging-stations/13481289/
",2014-08-03T00:00:00,Maxx Chatsko,"There aren't many electric vehicles on the road in the United States, especially when compared to the incumbent population of petrol-powered automobiles, but America does have an ample and renewable supply of cows, garbage, and flushable toilets. Leveraging our nation's strengths in the latter could help make electric vehicle charging stations -- including Tesla Motors' (TSLA) Supercharger sites -- as numerous and widespread as gas stations. No, this isn't a joke. And yes, this is actually quite probable. In fact, you'll wonder why it wasn't attempted sooner.How will it work? The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will now recognize natural gas fuels sourced from biogas (also called biomethane or renewable natural gas) captured at landfills, farms, and wastewater treatment plants as advanced biofuels. That won't help Tesla Motors as much as it helps Waste Management (WM) and Veolia Environment (VE) , but the agency also ruled that electricity created from combusting biomethane and used to power electric vehicles qualifies for the same advanced biofuel incentives (electric vehicles are covered under the Renewable Fuel Standard, too). The new rule could possibly bring the Tesla Supercharger network to your town by the end of the decade. Here's how.Tesla Motors' ambitious plansThe fierce battle over range anxiety and whether Tesla Motors' electric vehicle-charging stations would provide the coverage needed to combat it has played out many times in the last several years. Someone takes an ill-fated ride in a Tesla Model S and writes furiously about it, only to be refuted by an enthusiast easily completing a cross-country trip several weeks later. I'm not here to say the planned network is ill-equipped to cover its drivers. After all, it is intended to cover 98% of the American population in 2015.Covering 98% of the population means drivers will never be more than 100 miles away from a Supercharger. That's a pretty amazing accomplishment for the short amount of time needed to reach the milestone -- which will only improve as Tesla Motors brings mass market cars to market -- but there's plenty of work left to be done. Why not leverage America's vast biogas reserves to bring a Supercharger to every town or municipality?Biomethane boostIt's still much too early to say whether Tesla Motors will join forces with companies such as Waste Management, Veolia Environment, and large farming operations to expand Supercharger coverage, but the partnership potential makes almost too much sense. Regions with higher populations will have a greater need for charging stations. However, they'll also produce more garbage and wastewater and have a greater need to process such wastes. And while large farming operations are located in less dense population centers, they produce as much as 34% of the nation's methane. Good news: biomethane can be purified to pipeline-quality gas and shipped throughout the nation to where it is needed most.What's the potential for biomethane? The American Biogas Council estimates (link opens PDF) that roughly 540 landfills (22% of capacity), over 2,000 wastewater treatment plants (63%), and more than 6,300 farms (97%) across the nation have the potential to economically capture and use biomethane but aren't doing so today. In addition, thousands of sites could economically produce biogas from food waste or send it to an anaerobic digester at the local wastewater treatment plant to boost its output. To wrap your head around all of the untapped potential, consider the sites that are operational today.Now imagine if each dot represented a Supercharger. Fortunately, the future may arrive sooner than later. Waste Management has deployed 10 novel systems to optimize the production and capture of biomethane from its landfill sites with the aim of integrating the technology across its assets. The company is also on pace to produce over 950 megawatts of electricity from biogas by 2020. Meanwhile, Veolia Environment owns and operates over 200 wastewater treatment facilities throughout North America. That's nearly double the current fleet size of Supercharger stations in the United States!Foolish takeawayThere are obstacles to creating biomethane-powered Superchargers. For instance, Tesla Motors has worked diligently to introduce stations near diners, cafes, and shopping centers to give drivers something to do while their cars get juiced. No one wants to sit near a landfill or wastewater treatment facility to charge their ride. That can be alleviated by sending purified biomethane through a pipeline to a charging station, but it might get messy for utilities to prove they're sourcing their natural gas from renewable sources.In other words, it will take a few iterations and some market mishaps for the EPA to make the policy work for electricity produced away from the production source. It's more of a long-term opportunity -- perhaps by the end of the decade -- than an instant fix. That being said, there is an enormous potential for biomethane to power electric vehicles, natural gas cars and trucks, and even homes and businesses. While Tesla Motors investors may not have considered it before, Waste Management, Veolia Environment, and other companies with biomethane reserves could hold the key to making the Supercharger network not just a coast-to-coast operation, but a town-to-town system.The Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

",2014-08-05T00:00:00,"Sammy Roth, The Desert Sun","""This Tesla runs off geothermal brine."" Could that be the bumper-sticker of the future?An added draw for Tesla Motors TSLA to build its Gigafactory in California, say some business leaders, is the salt- and mineral-rich Salton Sea in the southern California desert.A company has recently developed game-changing technology to produce lithium from geothermal brine, a leftover of geothermal energy production at the Salton Sea — the state's largest lake.Tesla Motors is considering sites in five states — Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas — for its so-called Gigafactory that would produce lithium-ion batteries for its electric cars. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week that he expects the winning state to provide about 10 percent of the plant's construction costs, which could reach $5 billion.Southern California business leaders say Tesla's asking price — up to $500 million in state incentives — would be well worth paying.The 10 million-square-foot factory is expected to employ about 6,500 people. It would also boost mineral extraction from the Salton Sea, an industry that could generate $1.5 billion over 30 years.With the Model 3 set to hit the market in 2017, Tesla is in a hurry to build its battery factory. The company has already broken ground on a potential site in Nevada — part of a strategy, Musk has said, to break ground on several sites before making a final decision by the end of the year.The company had originally ruled out California due to the state's high tax burden and cost of living, but the prospect of abundant lithium from the Salton Sea has helped get the state back in the running. Simbol Materials is based in Northern California but has a plant in the desert town of Calipatria.If Simbol can scale up its lithium-extraction technology, California's odds of landing the Gigafactory could increase dramatically. A Tesla representative visited Simbol's local plant earlier this year.""If Simbol is successful in raising the money that they're looking to raise to expand their operation … this region all of a sudden has an overwhelming advantage for Tesla or any other manufacturer,"" said Joe Wallace, managing director of the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership's (CVEP) business incubator.California in July passed a measure that could give property tax credits for Tesla to locate the plant in California, and Gov. Edmund G. ""Jerry"" Brown signed it into law. Some news outlets have speculated Tesla, if it were to decide on California, could build the factory at the site of the former Concord Naval Weapons Station, in the northern part of the state.Even if Simbol's technology develops quickly enough, Tesla could still be lured elsewhere. Analysts say California has been losing jobs to states with lower tax rates and looser regulations, headlined by Toyota's April announcement that it would move its American headquarters from suburban Los Angeles to Plano, Texas.Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation president Timothy Kelley said he believes the state legislature could take several steps to lure battery manufacturers and other companies to California, such as instituting tax increment financing. But launching those measures might take too long for a company working on a tight timeline, he added.""If they have to wait to receive word about whether they're going to receive a tax grant or a tax credit, it's almost too late,"" he said.Energy Reporter Sammy Roth can be reached at (760) 778-4622, sammy.roth@desertsun.com, and @Sammy_Roth.",tesla,usatoday,,

A source told USA Today Wednesday that Tesla (TICKER: TSLA) had chosen Nevada for its giant battery factory. Tesla recently confirmed that it has been excavating at an industrial park near Reno, but stopped short of saying that it had made it the final choice for plant.A Tesla spokesperson told a reporter at Texas' KVUE-TV, in Austin, that talks will continue with Texas and four other states, and that the company always planned to choose more than one site.The February announcement that Tesla was shopping for a factory location touched off a high-stakes bidding war among California, Nevada, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. All have tax benefits and other incentives, including cash grants, to land major economic developments.Nevada recently passed a state law that could discount electricity 30 percent for the Tesla project in the first year.Musk has said he wants the factory to be powered by wind, solar or other renewable energy. But the factory is also likely to be tied into the larger electricity grid to supply steady power around the clock and back up intermittent renewable power sources.California lawmakers created draft legislation that would have offered incentives to Tesla to keep the battery factory in Tesla's home state, but convened last week without voting on the bill.""Tesla and Tesla's investments have always gone to California,"" said Joe Wallace, managing director of the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership, a business incubator near Palm Springs, Calif. ""They don't have an aversion to California.""Wallace argued that an inhibitive business environment has hurt the state's ability to compete for jobs, including those that the Gigafactory would have generated.""If you fight and lose, you live to fight another day. That's fine,"" Wallace said. ""But we didn't fight.""Brook Taylor, a spokesperson for the California Governor Jerry Brown's Office of Business and Economic Development, declined to comment on what prevented California and Tesla from reaching a deal.""No other state has added more jobs than California since the recovery began and we'll continue to work closely with businesses, including California-based Tesla, that want to grow here,"" Taylor said in an email.ARIZONA SPECIAL SESSIONArizona Rep. Ethan Orr, R-Tucson, suggested in June that Arizona call a special session to consider additional incentives to compete for the factory, in light of California's proposal.However, legislative leaders said at the time that Tesla had not provided a clear indication of what the state would need to do to get the factory, and they would not call such a session without that.""A special session sounded like a good idea at the time, but in hindsight, I don't think a special session would have helped,"" Orr said Wednesday. ""They made a very public show of playing states against each other, and that can lead to a race to the bottom.""He said Arizona would have a better chance at landing the next economic development project by increasing the funds available to close deals, providing a better educated workforce, lowering energy costs and being able to assemble and permit land faster.Chris Woodyard for USA Today in Los Angeles and KVUE-TV in Austin contributed to this report.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2014-09-04T00:00:00,John Shinal,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Rather than keeping a needed battery factory close to its headquarters and existing plant in Silicon Valley, Tesla plans to locate it about 235 miles closer to the site of the Burning Man Festival popular with CEO Elon Musk and other technology executives.In other words, just outside Reno, Nev.The metropolitan area that includes ""Biggest Little City in the World"" is about to get a whole lot of new, relatively high-paying jobs, giving its economic image -- a minor-league Las Vegas close to stunning mountains and Lake Tahoe ski resorts – a major buffing.Tesla's TSLA decision will add thousands jobs alongside the regional gambling mecca's thousands of blackjack dealers, croupiers, hotel maids, comics and other entertainers who now ply their trade there.Developers, construction companies and a wide array of services businesses on the Nevada side of the border are about to party like they just cleaned up at the craps table.Of the 6,500 jobs expected, 3,000 construction jobs will be created immediately, Nevada's governor said Thursday.Since the story first broke, I've already seen ads from Reno real estate agents in my Facebook news feed – next to reports from friends who attended this year's Burning Man. Elon Musk, a past devotee, didn't attend.CALIFORNIA FORTUNEYet every market story has at least one winner and loser, and Tesla has also taken a hefty economic prize away from the region that made its founder and CEO a billionaire.It was San Jose-based eBay which acquired PayPal, the online payments company then based in Mountain View, Calif., in a 2002 deal worth roughly $1.4 billion that made Musk his big fortune.Northern California is also home to Tesla's pioneering customers, as high-paid tech workers and executives from Sunnyvale to Novato have gone for the electric car like a vanity license plate.Yet when Musk had a chance to add thousands of jobs to the region's economy, he instead did what any auto-company executive might have done -- head for nearby Nevada, with its tax breaks and looser environmental rules.This will be a battery factory, after all.The tax savings will reduce the huge amount of capital that Tesla and battery partner Panasonic have to sink into the facility, being built to ensure enough batteries for all the cars Musk plans to build in the company's Fremont, Calif. plant.It will also move the work away from a region with a tech-heavy workforce to one where 1970s musical acts like Boston and Foghat can still get occasional work, and where comedian Howie Mandel usually makes a stop on the way to Vegas.Whether the jobs Tesla creates will be classified as tech workers or auto workers may depend on who you ask.Investors have so far valued Tesla more like a technology company than an auto company.Yet as Tesla's factory decision makes clear, Musk is managing Tesla more like an automaker these days.John Shinal has covered tech and financial markets for more than 15 years at Bloomberg, BusinessWeek,The San Francisco Chronicle, Dow Jones MarketWatch, Wall Street Journal Digital Network and others.

",2014-09-05T00:00:00,James R. Healey,"Tesla Motors shares lost 3% Friday after CEO Elon Musk said the stock looked expensive.The drop to $277.39 shaved a portion of Tesla's (TSLA) year-to-date gain. It followed Tesla's decision, announced Thursday, to accept a $1.25 billion tax incentive offer from Nevada, more than twice as much as Musk had said it would take to get his ""gigafactory"" battery plant.The S&P 500 closed up 0.5% Friday, setting a record.Musk had said in an interview Thursday night with CNBC that Tesla stock was ""kinda high right now"" unless investors are eyeing long-term returns. The stock has surged 84% this year. It hit a record earlier this week after brokerage Stifel set a $400 target for the stock.At least one analysis says the massive battery plant won't do well.Manufacturing lithium-ion batteries in massive numbers ""will bring about only a modest reduction in battery costs, and create significant overcapacity, given likely sales of less than half the targeted 500,000,"" according to Lux Research, based in Boston.The Lux report says, ""Tesla and its partner, Panasonic, will contribute about 45% and 35%, respectively, of the initial $4 billion required to build the Gigafactory, proposed to go on-stream in 2017."" Lux projects sales of only 240,000 cars in 2020, ""leading to razor-thin margins to Panasonic and 57% overcapacity.""And, Lux contends, ""The Gigafactory will only reduce the Tesla Model 3's cost by $2,800, not enough to sway the success of the planned lower-cost EV.""The Nevada sweetener is a 20-year tax incentive package that would have the effect of letting the car company's factory operate essentially tax-free for a decade.It's an offer from the governor and must be OK'd by the legislature.Nevada sees it, literally, as a full-employment plan. ""It will allow every under-employed person to reach full employment,"" said Gov.

",2014-09-06T00:00:00,Tamara Rutter,"Tesla Motors' (TSLA) cult-like following has catapulted the electric-car upstart into a global market flush with adoring fans. Unlike traditional automakers such as Ford and GM, Tesla doesn't have a massive advertising budget, nor does it conduct multinational marketing campaigns. Instead, Tesla relies on word-of-mouth marketing and mall showrooms for selling its cars. This works because of Tesla's tremendous brand loyalty.In fact, Tesla Motors received the highest owner satisfaction score in Consumer Reports' annual survey last year. According to the magazine, ""Owners of the Tesla Model S gave it the highest owner-satisfaction score Consumer Reports has seen in years: 99 out of 100.Let's dig into the psychology of brand loyalty and see why Tesla Motors boasts some of the most loyal customers since Apple.Make an enemyOne thing that helped set Apple apart from other computer brands was its ability to create an enemy in the minds of consumers. Renowned psychologist Henri Tajfel discovered that by establishing minor distinctions between two groups of people he could artificially create loyalty within the groups. Apple achieved this by targeting Microsoft as the foe, while also distinguishing Apple products as the anti-PC solution.Tesla's enemies, on the other hand, are vehicles with internal combustion engines and big automakers. Many EV drivers today derive an emotional attachment from driving something that isn't your typical gas-powered car. Another advantage for Tesla is the fact that it offers customers something different: new tech from a new company. This is similar to Apple of days past, which offered a different tech platform than PCs and a small user base which identified with being ""different.""Tesla has also created an enemy out of auto dealer associations, which are fighting Tesla's disruptive model of selling its cars directly to consumers through its own company-owned retail stores. By publicly opposing the decades-old auto dealership model of selling cars, Tesla is blazing a new path and picking up loyal supporters along the way. This has spurred auto dealership associations to file lawsuits against Tesla Motors that hope to ban the electric-car maker from selling its vehicles in numerous states throughout the country.Tesla simply wants to sell its cars directly to consumers at its own retail stores rather than going through dealerships, which the company says make the bulk of their revenue from servicing customers' cars. Tesla, on the other hand, has vowed never to make servicing a profit center -- a move that only strengthens consumer support for the California-based company.Scores of Tesla drivers have expressed their loyalty to Tesla by showing up in person at state capitols to protest dealer suits against the EV maker in various states such as Texas and Missouri.On its popular blog site, Tesla posts entries such as this urging its loyal followers to join it in taking action against these state dealer associations. In May, dozens of Tesla drivers came to Missouri's capital to support allowing Tesla to sell its cars directly to consumers in the state. Meanwhile, dozens of consumers have posted messages on Tesla's blog this year regarding their intention to reach out to state legislators in support of the automaker.According to various psychological studies, this outpouring of support and loyalty wouldn't be nearly as strong without an enemy, so perhaps the ongoing dealership battles are a blessing in disguise.Establishing an emotional connectionAnother way that psychologists explain brand loyalty is through emotional connection. All of the most recognizable brands today have one thing in common: They make an emotional connection with consumers. One of the easiest ways for a brand to do this is by standing for something. In fact, a study by marketing research firm CEB found that rather than being loyal to a company per se, people are loyal to what that company represents.Tesla wins major points in this regard because it is passionately dedicated to promoting mass adoption of electric vehicles in hopes of one day solving our planet's energy problem. People feel good about driving a Tesla because they no longer need to buy gas, and as a bonus, they're helping the planet in the process.Many Tesla drivers have launched meet-ups or social gatherings for fellow owners and enthusiasts to connect with one another. There are also dozens of meet-up groups around the world for electric-car enthusiasts in general. The important takeaway here is that creating sustainable energy solutions is an increasingly important cause today, one to which millions of people are committed.Consumer reportsIn today's increasingly social world, transparency is key for creating enduring brand loyalty. Companies want to build lasting relationships with their customers, and one way to do so is through open communication. No automaker does this better than Tesla Motors.Tesla in recent years has built its reputation for quality and customer support by communicating with consumers on social media and its own blog. Last year, when Tesla was hit with negative publicity involving a Model S fire, CEO Elon Musk was quick to address the issue in a blog entry and via social media channels such as Twitter and Facebook. Tesla even published its email correspondence with the Model S owner whose car caught fire (with his permission, of course), so the public might better understand what happened.Because of this transparency, customers feel like they have a personal relationship with Tesla. A great example of that occurred this week when two Tesla drivers submitted an open letter to Musk via a full-page ad in a Palo Alto, California, newspaper. As you can see in the picture, the letter asked that Tesla make a few changes to its Model S.Challenge accepted. Not only did Musk personally respond via Twitter, but he also said Tesla would indeed implement some of the suggested changes. If that doesn't foster brand loyalty, I'm not sure what does. Whether it is effectively communicating its brand mission with consumers or publicly taking a stand against dealerships, Tesla Motors knows how to cultivate brand loyalty.Disclosure: Tamara Rutter owns shares of Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla Motors.

",2014-09-11T00:00:00,Anjeanette Damon,"The Nevada Senate introduced late Wednesday night a major omnibus bill that would enact a massive $1.25 billion tax break for Tesla to build its battery Gigafactory in Nevada.The special session continues Thursday. Nevada's state Assembly also must pass a tax break bill. Approval by the legislature is necessary to finalize a tax incentive package assembled by the Nevada governor's office to beat out four other states to win the business project, which promises 6,500 new jobs.Here are eight things you should know about how the law will be structured:It's not just Tesla that could be eligible: The Legislature can't author a bill for one company. So it has to set perimeters for how a company would be eligible for the 100 percent tax abatements offered to Tesla TSLA. In this case, a company would be required to invest $3.5 billion in materials and equipment over 10 years.Half of the workers must be Nevadans, but there's an out: The bill requires half of the construction workers and half of the permanent factory workers be from Nevada. Tesla will be required to keep such things as driver's licenses and car registrations of its employees on file to prove the quota has been met. However, if Tesla can demonstrate it can't find enough qualified employees in Nevada, it can ask the economic development director for a waiver.MIXED FEELINGS:  Here's why tax experts are talking about the Tesla dealTransparency is key: The bill requires the economic development office to approve the abatements in a public meeting. At the announcement of the public meeting, Tesla's application will become public. Of course there's a caveat here, too. Tesla can ask the director to keep confidential any proprietary information. The director gets to make the final decision and the law seeks to bar ""judicial review"" of that decision.Economic development director gets massive authority: The bill doesn't specify exactly what kind of proof Tesla must submit to demonstrate it is keeping up its end of the investment and hiring bargain in order to be eligible for the abatements. The director can decide whether the documentation provided by the company is acceptable.You want reporting, we've got reporting: The bill requires Tesla to submit annual audits of its workforce and investment progress. The Economic Development Office is then required to file annual reports detailing the number of jobs created, the dollars invested, the wages paid and more.ROADS, HOUSING, SHOPPING, SCHOOLS:  Envisioning the impacts of a Tesla Gigafactory on everyday life in RenoTransferable tax credit program: Tesla will get a $12,500 transferable tax credit for up to 6,000 qualified employees, who work at least 30 hours a week and make an average of $22 an hour. The credit program expires in 2022. While Tesla must report when it sells a tax credit to another company and describe which revenue stream the credit will be used against (gaming, insurance premium or modified business tax) it doesn't have to make public the sales price.Yes there are clawbacks: If Tesla doesn't live up to its end of the bargain by investing up to $3.5 billion in 10 years or hiring the number of workers it says it will in its application for the abatements, it will have to pay back its abatements with interest. Tesla must also continue to operate in the state for a time period decided by the economic development director or it must pay back its abatements.What about that pesky Constitution? In 1956, Nevada voters approved a ballot initiative creating a 2 percent sales and use tax, which has become part of the state's roughly 7.75 percent sales tax rate. Because voters enacted the tax, the Legislature is prohibited from tampering with it. That means lawmakers can't issue a 100 percent sales tax abatement. But, the lawmakers can allow local governments to rebate that 2 percent back to qualified businesses. To do that, Senate Bill 1 allows cities or counties to create a new kind of tax incentive district, called an economic diversification district. The local government can then rebate to any qualified business in the district that 2 percent sales tax. The local government can also ask Tesla to agree to make payments to offset the cost of local government services provided to the company.MORE ON TESLA:",tesla,usatoday,,

",2014-09-12T00:00:00,Ray Hagar,"The Nevada Legislature late Thursday approved the $1.25 billion deal brokered by Gov. Brian Sandoval to bring Tesla Motors' $5 billion battery Gigafactory to Northern Nevada.Both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously approved the deal, strung together with four bills including the marquee measure, Senate Bill 1. Sandoval will sign the legislation late Thursday, local time.SB1 gives Tesla TSLA about $1.25 billion in tax abatements in exchange for Tesla investing $3.5 billion in the state within the first 10 years of the agreement. It passed the Senate with a 21-0 vote.No senator spoke about the bill before the vote was taken, except for Senate Majority Leader Mo Denis, D-Las Vegas. A handful of Assembly members spoke in favor of the legislation before the final vote was taken.The magnitude of the deal was not lost on lawmakers. Many see the agreement as just the beginning of a huge change in Northern Nevada that will affect the region's infrastructure, including roads and schools.""We have a lot more to do but this is a great way to start,"" said Assembly Speaker Marilyn Kirkpatrick, D-North Las Vegas.Assemblyman David Bobzien, D-Reno, was also thinking about the future as the deal made its way through the Legislature late Thursday.""It is interesting to contemplate the future (and) changing demographics to the counties surrounding Tesla,"" Bobzien posted on his Twitter account.Added Sen. Justin Jones, D-Las Vegas: ""This is obviously an historic and exciting day for our great state.""LOSERS: AUTO DEALERS, INSURANCEAt the Capitol last week, Sandoval and Tesla CEO Elon Musk appeared together to announce they had reached an agreement to bring a lithium battery plant to the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. Yet the deal needed to be approved by the Legislature before it went into effect.Although the tax-abatement bill was the major piece of legislation, three other bills also passed both houses Thursday:• Assembly Bill 1: Provides Tesla with eight years of discounted electricity from NV Energy. The law expands the existing discount period to eight years from four years and requires the company to sign a 10-year contract to purchase grid power from the utility. The value of the discount is estimated to be about $8 million over the eight years. Northern Nevada power customers will see their bill go up about $1.52 a year to pay for Tesla's discount.• Assembly Bill 2: Allows electric car manufacturers to sell directly to consumers, bypassing the need for a dealership. This has been a contested issue in Texas and Arizona, where auto dealers and their lobbying arms worked to prevent Tesla and other manufacturers from selling directly to customers.• Assembly Bill 3: Eliminates a tax break for insurance companies that locate their home offices in Nevada. The tax break is worth about $25 million a year. That money will be shifted to pay for Tesla's tax incentive package. Insurance companies will keep their tax break until Jan. 1, 2016, when the program will shrink to $5 million a year. It will be completely eliminated in 2021.FILM TAX-CREDITAfter the Senate passed all four bills, many senators expressed concern that not enough money is being given to the K-12 education system.The special session also ended with a lot of promises. Those who were negatively impacted by the deal hoped to regain lost tax breaks.First, Jim Wadhams, a longtime insurance industry lobbyist, said that tax break the industry will lose because of the Tesla deal may be, and should, be revisited in the 2015 session that starts in February.State Sen. Debbie Smith, D-Sparks, who was seeking money for school infrastructure needs in the Tesla deal, said that could not be accomplished in the special session — the issues lawmakers could consider were narrowly defined by the governor's proclamation for the special session. Instead, she said she will push for school infrastructure funding at the beginning of the 2015 session.And state Sen. Kelvin Atkinson, D-Las Vegas, said he expected the movie-production tax credit to be replenished in 2015. The Tesla deal will take $70 million out of the fund over four years, which will cut the fund to just $10 million.MORE ON TESLA:",tesla,usatoday,,

",2014-10-07T00:00:00,Judith E. Schaeffer,"The Supreme Court's stunning announcement Monday that it had declined to hear any of the seven marriage equality cases in which review had been sought prompted immediate and understandable joy among supporters of marriage equality. The court's action cleared the way for same-sex couples to marry in the five states involved in the pending cases as well as in six other states within the jurisdiction of the three appellate courts whose rulings striking down state bans on same-sex marriage were potentially up for review. That adds 11 states to the 19 (plus the District of Columbia) in which marriage equality is already a reality. As the historic news flew around the country, commentator after commentator pronounced the battle for same-sex marriage effectively over. Maybe the marriage equality writing is on the wall — and I think it surely is — but the battle isn't over until it's actually over.A Supreme Court denial of review is not a ruling on the merits. And while I agree it would invite ""legal chaos"" if the court at some later date were to hold that the Constitution does not require states to allow same-sex couples to marry, perhaps leading to the unraveling of same-sex marriages, it's still legally possible that this could happen, though it is not morally conceivable. What if a conservative Republican is elected president in 2016, and one or two more justices who share the ideology of Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito are confirmed to the bench?In addition, even assuming that Monday's action does send a strong signal as to where the present court is headed, what about the states not affected by Monday's action? Practically lost in all of the celebrating is the recognition that there are still 20 states that prohibit same-sex marriage. That number may drop to 15 if you assume that the Ninth Circuit will soon rule in favor of marriage equality in the cases argued before it last month, but for now it remains 20. Those states include Texas and Florida — large population centers. How long must gay men and lesbians in those 20 states wait for their constitutional rights to equality and liberty to be recognized?Is there genuine hope for gay men and lesbians in most of those states, barring Supreme Court action? The Fifth Circuit, with jurisdiction over Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi — all states with bans on same-sex marriage — is one of the most conservative in the country. Will that court decide that states can define marriage for themselves, and that the Constitution allows them to discriminate against same-sex couples? It's certainly possible. And if an appellate court eventually does uphold a marriage ban, will the Supreme Court agree to review that case? How long will it take to act?There's a potential sad parallel here from the history of state bans on interracial marriage. In 1948, the California Supreme Court became the first state court to strike down such a ban; it would take another 19 years for the Supreme Court, in Loving v. Virginia, to hold that the U.S. Constitution prohibits such laws. In the intervening years, a number of states repealed their own laws, but at the time of the court's ruling in Loving, 16 states still prohibited interracial marriage. How long would it have taken for those states to do the right thing in the absence of a Supreme Court ruling?It's not terribly surprising, to me, at least, that there's a significant overlap between the states that, pre-Loving, still prohibited interracial marriage, and the states that, after Monday's action by the court, still prohibit same-sex marriage. Many of them are in the deep South, some are border states. And just as those states had to be dragged kicking and screaming into respecting the fundamental right to marry of all persons regardless of race, I fear the same will be necessary for at least some of them when it comes to marriage equality for same-sex couples. While I don't think that it will take 19 more years for nationwide marriage equality, every day that gay men and lesbians are denied their constitutional rights and suffer the harms that follow is one day too many.So my joy is tempered by the sadness of knowing that, for so many gay men and lesbians in this country, marriage equality is still a constitutional promise not yet fulfilled.Judith E.

Shares were down 6.4% as of midafternoon Friday.Tesla also said at a big briefing event here that it'll have a hopped-up version of its Model S that has all-wheel drive and blasts to 60 mph in little more than 3 seconds.Musk said in an interview with USA TODAY that one of his favorite cars was the super-fast McLaren F1, a high-dollar, low-volume production car with racing attributes. Musk thinks the quickest Tesla will match the McLaren's 3.2-second sprint to 60 mph from standstill.""It's like having your own personal roller coaster,"" he says.Tesla's moves are closely watched by its shareholders, who seem to bid up stock prices wildly, then sell, so the Tesla shares TSLA rocket, then tumble, more like technology stocks than auto-company stocks. And the electric-carmaker's moves often are considered a foretaste of what mainstream automakers might need to emulate to stay abreast of the latest technology.Tesla announced Thursday that the all-wheel-drive versions of its Model S electric car will manage a slight increase in range of about 10 miles on a charge vs. the rear-drive models — for a maximum of 275 miles — because of efficiencies designed into the new system.The AWD cars have a second electric motor to drive the front wheels. AWD hybrids, such as the Lexus RX, likewise use separate electric motors front and rear to eliminate the need for a front-to-rear driveshaft and other cumbersome AWD hardware.Musk, though, called his system ""a huge improvement"" that he claims is ""taking the technology to the next level.""The AWD cars will carry the designation D, and the new top version of the AWD Model S will be designated P85D. Buyers begin receiving those in December.The other AWD models, 60D and 85D, arrive in buyers' hands in February.The addition of all-wheel drive will allow Tesla to compete more vigorously in the snowy East and Midwest, broadening its buyer base beyond the Sunbelt.Jaguar made a similar move to AWD in 2013, figuring it was competing in a shrinking slice of the luxury market without AWD, offered by most rivals.Tesla's suite of safety features and driver aids is partly catch-up, partly leapfrog.Tesla says the cars it's building now have forward-mounted radar, a camera and 12 sensors each able to ""see"" 16 feet to enable the safety tech. Those can't be retrofitted to older models, Tesla says.It also ties the system into the steering, braking and GPS, making it capable of unusual tricks that can't be matched by other cars.Highlights:•The new system will move the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal.•The car reads speed-limit signs and adjusts the car to the speed on the sign.•Drivers will be able to get out of the car in their driveways and watch it park itself in the garage. When drivers are ready to leave, the car will able to drive itself up, with the car's temperature and stereo system set to the driver's preferences.""It will come to you wherever you are,"" Musk says. ""It will slowly make its way to you.""Other features match the lane-departure warnings and additional safety and driver-help features that are getting common.Brands from Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti to more mainstream nameplates such as Hyundai have features that will keep a car in its lane, steer it back if it begins to wander, stop without driver help if it's racing too fast toward the car ahead.The new AWD versions of the Model S made their debut at a general-aviation airport in this Los Angeles suburb. The ceremony included scores of current Model S owners.Owner Nikki Lennertz says she was impressed. ""I think Elon Musk is a game changer"" and she said what he's doing with electric cars ""will change the auto industry in general.""",tesla,usatoday,,

Healey,"Profit forecast moved up from %22late 2013%22Reported fourth-quarter loss of %2489.9 millionSays production of new Model S electric sedan now at 20%2C000-a-year paceTesla said today in federal filings and a letter to shareholders that the electric-car maker expects to be ""slightly profitable"" in the first quarter, its first-ever profit, revised from earlier guidance of black ink by ""late 2013.""The guidance was part of Tesla's earning report today. The California-based auto company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $89.9 million on revenue of $306.3 million. Production of its new Model S electric car increased in the quarter. and about 2,400 were delivered, about 10 times as many as in the third quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Tesla reported a loss of slightly less, $81.5 million, on revenue of $39.4 million as sales of its initial product, a high-performance electric sports car, ended.For all of 2012 the company lost $396.2 million on revenue of $413.3 million. That was an improvement from 2011's loss of $254.4 million on revenue of $204.2 million.Investors were unimpressed and bid down the stock price 74 cents, to $38.54, a 1.9% drop. So far this year, though, Tesla (traded on NASDAQ as TSLA) is up 9%.Tesla began producing its Model S, a sedan that can seat up to seven with an unusual, optional, rear-facing jump seat, last June. The car, meant to compete with Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-class and other mid-size luxury cars, is made at Fremont, Calif., in a factory once used by General Motors and Toyota in a joint venture building compact cars.The company got a $465 million loan from the U.S. Energy Department to overhaul the factory and dow other work. Terms of the repayment have been revised and Energy has told Tesla to speed its repayment.The fourth-quarter deliveries of the Model S completed Tesla's run of the sedan's initial version -- a special-edition SIgnature model with the top-end 85 kWh battery pack. It has the longest range of any battery offered in the car. Tesla pegs it at 300 miles under ideal conditions. The government rates it 265 miles. Published evaluations by independent testers have fallen below 200 miles, which still is the longest driving range of any electric on sale in the U.S..Production of the S was slow to ramp up and missed earlier goals for 2012, Tesla said. It now is turning out the cars at a 20,000 annual pace.And it said its margins grew to about 8% in the quarter and forecast margins of 25% by the end of 2013 due to a higher production rate for the S. It also said that it had development revenue of $12 million from its deal with Mercedes-Benz to work on a B-Class electric vehicle.",tesla,usatoday,,

The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 9.53 points, or 0.63%, to 1,502.42, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 32.92 points, or 1.04%, to 3,131.49.The indexes have soared this year to their highest levels since the financial crisis, but may be ready to fall back to earth, said Kim Caughey Forrest, senior analyst with Fort Pitt Capital Group, a portfolio management firm in Pittsburgh.""I think the market has gotten ahead of itself,"" she said. She said fourth-quarter earnings have generally met expectations, but only after those expectations were reduced when companies made dire projections in November and December.European stocks were sharply lower a day after U.S. stocks sustained some of their steepest declines this year. A monthly survey of European executives showed that business activity in the European Union slowed in February, a strong signal that a downturn that began last year will continue into 2013.Stock indexes in France, England and Germany finished the day down more than 1.5%.Signaling that the U.S. labor market remains in slow recovery mode, the government said more people applied for unemployment benefits last week.Wal-Mart Stores rose after beating analysts' profit expectations in the fourth quarter. However, the biggest retailer warned of a slow start to the year. It gained $1.05, or 1.5%, to $70.26.The company said after a strong start to the holiday season, the first three weeks of December were weak, and business has been volatile since then. Wal-Mart attributed some of what it is seeing to a delay in tax refund checks that have left people strapped for cash.""Everybody's gotten a 2 percent pay cut, and people who file their taxes early are not getting a refund back in a timely manner,"" Forrest said.Supermarket chain Safeway (SWY) was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, rising $2.82, or 14%, to $22.95. Its jumped 13% in the fourth quarter, helped by higher gift and prepaid card revenue.Electric car company Tesla Motors (TSLA) plunged after a day after reporting that its fourth-quarter net loss grew 10% on costs related to production of its new Model S. The stock fell $3.42, or 8%, to $35.12.Asian stocks closed sharply lower. The sell-off began Wednesday afternoon in New York after the release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting suggesting that some policymakers want to wind down bond purchases and other measures aimed at boosting the economy.The minutes showed new divisions over the Fed's low-interest rate policies. There is no sign of inflation, yet there was more evidence that some Fred officials are ready to ease off the stimulus programs before the economy has fully recovered.The Fed's bond-buying has been boosting markets by reducing the cost of borrowing for companies and investors, Forrest explained. When interest rates are lower, it's possible to do business cheaper even if a company isn't growing, she said.""Thinking maybe interest rates will creep higher, this is a very chilling scenario"" for the market, she said.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.98% from 2.05% early Wednesday as demand increased for ultra-safe assets.",tesla,usatoday,,

LaReauDetroit Free Press,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:000:49ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenMeet the vehicle expected to help revive Cadillac and position the General Motors' brand to compete with rival luxury electric vehicle makers – most notably Tesla.The Lyriq is an all-electric two-row SUV that Cadillac first mentioned in January 2019 at the Detroit auto show, flashing an artist rendering of a vague futuristic car on the screen.On Thursday, GM revealed what the actual vehicle will look like when it goes on sale in the United States in late 2022. It will launch first in China.Cadillac is not announcing yet which U.S. factory will assemble the Lyriq, but a source familiar with production said it will not be made at Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly, even though that facility is being retooled to build several new all-electric vehicles. The source requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information.New Ford CEO:Jim Farley says taking role is 'paying it forward for my grandfather'Fiat Chrysler:Car maker planning for big recall on engine used in JeepsCadillac is also not releasing the Lyriq's starting price, saying that it will cost, ""less than $75,000, but be in the sweet spot for a mid-sized crossover with maybe a slight premium in the early days,"" said Steve Carlisle, GM's president of North America. What GM will talk about is the importance the Lyriq holds for the luxury brand's future.""It offers a pivot point for the brand to gain momentum,"" Carlisle told reporters.Cornerstone for the futureLast year and into early this year, Cadillac was in the midst of a brand rebirth with new SUVs and the CT4 and CT5 sedans coming out. The redesigned 2020 Escalade SUV was on its way to market. The fresh lineup would provide the long-awaited jump start to Cadillac sales.Then the coronavirus pandemic hit the nation in March. In the second quarter, Cadillac U.S. sales spiraled down 41.4% to 23,296 vehicles. For 2020 through June, the brand's sales are off by 29.2% to 53,621 compared with the year-ago period. The brand has struggled for years to get its sales up near its peak in 2005, when Cadillac sold 235,002 cars. Last year, it sold 156,246, according to Edmunds.But the Lyriq is now seen as ""a cornerstone in which we will build a future and that future will include additional EVs that we’ll add to the Lyriq in the next few years,"" Carlisle told the media.GM has said it envisions an all-electric future as a company. It plans to bring at least 20 new EVs to market by 2023 and it's tagged Cadillac as the brand to showcase the technology first. Cadillac's transformation to an anticipated all-electric lineup by 2030 will be calculated and gradual with the Lyriq taking the lead, Carlisle said.""We really have to work through what this transformation is going to take across the emerging ecosystem and how we engage a broad range of stakeholders to ensure our mutual success,"" Carlisle said. ""As demand comes, we anticipate a range of conditions necessary to promote the adoption of EV, including preparing our dealer network, expanding the charging infrastructure and grow customer acceptance. We’re not going for a sugar high.”It is an ambitious and difficult transition and the Lyriq is a challenging launch for Cadillac, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of insights. Caldwell pointed out that while other luxury brands offer electric SUVs, only Tesla has sold large numbers with its Model X, which features distinctive gull-wing rear doors.Taking on TeslaBut there is more to the Lyriq's success than sales, Caldwell said. If the technology and the vehicle are well-executed, it may be ""a unique opportunity to help Cadillac transform its brand,"" she said.""The company has been trying – and failing – for years to elevate its image,"" Caldwell said. ""If Cadillac does it right and can get consumers to view the Lyriq as competitive with Tesla and other European luxury brands, this could help give the brand a push in the right direction."" It is more about branding because at the moment, sales in the luxury electric SUV space are minuscule. The current players – Tesla Model X, Jaguar I-Pace and Audi e-tron – have combined sales of less than 12,000 units in the first half of 2020, Caldwell said. That compares with the same period last year, when COVID did not exist, when the three sold 13,000.Cadillac plans to top its rivals by offering a better overall package beyond just a good-looking car, Carlisle said. To take on Tesla, he said Cadillac will address customer pain points around EVs such as: battery range, charging time, connectivity and craftsmanship.The Lyriq is based on GM's next-generation, modular electric vehicle platform. It will be propelled by GM's Ultium battery system and get more than 300 miles on a full charge. A customer will be able to charge it from home, a workplace or on the road, GM said. This is an early look at the vehicle's features given it won't go on sale for two years.GM is working to offer the infrastructure to support EVs, Carlisle said, noting GM's recent partnership with EVgo. The companies will add more than 2,700 new fast chargers at various public venues over the next five years.""All of that makes it a truly compelling product,"" Carlisle said. ""It starts and ends with product, but it’s also about the entire customer experience and ownership experience.""Used cars:Prices spiking as COVID-19 pandemic shakes up the market for new carsFound funds?:How to find unclaimed money that may be owed to you'Eliminate friction'The Lyriq's marketing is crucial, too. Cadillac must give customers a seamless experience with buying and owning the vehicle, said Melissa Grady, Cadillac's chief marketing officer.“We need to ... eliminate any friction. When you look at a truly friction-less process you know it. It's the feeling like buying something on Amazon and two clicks and it’s on your doorstep,"" Grady said. ""That’s not where we are now. But we know this is extremely important to EV customers.""Cadillac is looking at ways to improve the myCadillac Mobile App .“We’re totally re-imagining the app,"" Grady said. ""How do we create a worry-free experience? We’re looking at the charging ecosystem and telling people where they can stop along their journey — knowing ahead of time what their journey is — to recharge.""Grady said her team is looking at every aspect of, ""what it means to be Cadillac for our EV future. The launch of Lyriq is more than just the launch of the vehicle, it’s our future.""The Escaliq?In February, Cadillac launched the redesigned 2020 Escalade, its popular full-size SUV. It has 6,000 orders, Carlisle said. “We’ll start shipping those to dealers at the end of the month and in early September,” Carlisle said.The Escalade has been a Cadillac icon for years, so expect an all-electric version of the vehicle, which GM alluded to in its recently released 2019 Sustainability report and Carlisle hinted at as well.“The Escalade is a franchise on to its own,"" Carlisle said. ""In other venues we’ve talked about electrified trucks and larger vehicles. So stay tuned on that one.”But will it still be called the Escalade? Cadillac has said its electric vehicles will have proper names rather than a numeric tag. There have been reports that the electric vehicles will all end in ""iq,"" prompting the media to ask if an electric Escalade would also have a name change.""The Escalade has a name and we don’t intend to change that, as to what would we name an EV Escalade? That's a conversation for another day,"" Carlisle said.He said any change to the iconic Escalade name would be a difficult decision, but Carlisle diplomatically said, ""We’ll take it under advisement,"" when reporters asked whether Cadillac would tack “iq” on the end of the name for an electric Escalade.Why did my electric bill go up?

A decision on that will be made later.Local government restrictions forced the electric car and solar panel maker to close its only U.S. assembly factory in Fremont, California, from March 23 to May 11. The company paid roughly 10,000 workers for part of the shutdown and continued health care and other benefits.Excluding one-time items such as $347 million in stock-based compensation, Tesla made $2.18 cents per share. That beat Wall Street estimates of a break-even quarter, according to FactSet. Revenue was down 4.9% from a year ago to $6.04 billion for the quarter. That still beat estimates of $5.15 billion.Toyota:2021 Venza hybrid SUV combines Lexus style with Toyota valueJobless claims:Over a million more expected to file as coronavirus pauses reopeningsThe company said its progress in the first half of the year has positioned it for success in the second half as production output continues to improve. Telsa also said it has picked a site for its second U.S. assembly plant, although the location wasn’t released. The Austin, Texas, area appeared to be the front-runner but Tulsa, Oklahoma, was a possibility.The surprising profit, compared with a $408 million loss a year ago, pushed Tesla’s shares up 5.1% to $1,674.09 in after-hours trading.Tesla would have lost money, though, without $428 million it earned from selling electric vehicle credits to other automakers so they can meet government fuel economy and pollution regulations.The company said its profit increased over the first quarter’s tiny $16 million because of “fundamental operational improvements.”But it issued a note of caution in its investor letter released Wednesday after the markets closed: “It remains difficult to predict whether there will be further operational interruptions or how global consumer sentiment will evolve in the second half of 2020.”Why did my electric bill go up?

The next five worst-scoring brands were Land Rover (228), Audi (225), Volvo (210), Mercedes-Benz (202) and Jaguar (190). In general, luxury brands struggled in the 2020 study in part due to problems with their infotainment systems.In Tesla's case, though, problems included paint defects, poor fit of body panels, trunks and hoods that were hard to open and close, too much wind noise in the interior, squeaks and rattles, according to J.D. Power's automotive President Doug Betts.J.D. Power study:These are the 26 highest-quality cars, trucks, SUVs of 2020The issues were ""primarily a result of factory quality,"" Betts said in an emailed statement.Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment Wednesday afternoon.Dave Sargent, vice president of automotive quality at J.D. Power, added that ""it's important to note that the primary reason for Tesla’s score is not the EV-related aspects of the vehicle – they perform well here.""J.D. Power did not technically include Tesla in its rankings since the automaker does not provide permission to survey its powers in the 15 states where it is legally required. But J.D. Power said it collected data from Tesla owners in the other 35 states, providing sufficient information to score the company's performance.To be sure, initial quality does not necessarily translate into popularity or durability. Many Americans buy cars for other reasons, including styling, size, fuel efficiency, utility, price and status.For example, the highest-ranking luxury brand in the survey was Hyundai's Genesis. But Genesis has struggled to gain traction among car buyers, while Tesla has surged.Overall, the J.D.

",2020-08-07T00:00:00,Jefferson GrahamUSA TODAY,"In China, western media is not allowed, hence users cannot access the world's most popular free chat application, Facebook-owned WhatsApp, to make free calls and texts.One local app, however, dominates: WeChat, owned by Tencent Technology, which has its hands in many U.S. companies, including Snap, Tesla, Activision Blizzard, Reddit and Epic Games, which publishes the mega-smash Fortnite.  Additionally, it owns a portion of Sweden-based Spotify and all of Riot Games, home of the League of Legends game.President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order banning the use of WeChat in the United States, a ban that would extend to Apple and Google offering downloads in their app stores.He also signed a separate order banning the Chinese app TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance. Both are to go into effect by mid-September. ByteDance is negotiating with Microsoft to sell its US based operations, which would allow the millions of young people who love TikTok to keep on using it.Meanwhile, ByteDance says it plans to sue to stop the ban.Fight:TikTok threatens legal action after President Trump issues executive order to block appInfluence:Snap embraces mini-apps withing its own, further reflecting Chinese WeChat's influenceTikTok is one of the most used apps in the United States, currently No. 4 on Apple's iTunes chart and No. 5 on Google Play. But what about WeChat?It doesn't crack the top 50 on the domestic charts, but that's not the case in China, where it's used by over 1 billion people.What is WeChat?—It says it connects a billion people with ""calls, chats and more."" The more includes reading news, playing games, downloading colorful stickers, engaging in challenges with friends to see who can walk more steps and using the app to pay for stuff.—The app is currently available domestically on the Apple and Google app stores, but you need to know somebody before you can register. WeChat instructs you to have a friend take a picture of a QR code required for membership first.—WeChat is widely used in the United States by people who used to live in China and use it to communicate with loved ones, by Chinese students studying here and interacting with people at home. CNBC notes that banning WeChat here in the U.S. would be ""devastating"" to Chinese families.Beyond that, add in anyone who does business with China, with for the tech industry, includes pretty much all participants. Most of the world's most popular tech products are manufactured in Shenzhen, the home base for Tencent. Those products include the iPhone, Ring doorbell and most Amazon labeled products, like the Echo and Fire TV devices, and many popular TV brands, including TCL and Hisense.So what's the problem with WeChat?Trump says any app based in China is an issue. The app captures ""personal and proprietary information of Chinese nationals visiting the United States, thereby allowing the Chinese Communist Party a mechanism for keeping tabs on Chinese citizens who may be enjoying the benefits of a free society for the first time in their lives,"" Trump's order said.Tencent says it stores users data in Hong Kong and Ontario, Canada. It says it won't share the data, except ""if we are instructed to by a court, authority or compelled by law.""Tencent owns two popular chat apps, WeChat and QQ. Both are similar, but WeChat is aimed more at the broader Asian market, while QQ is focused solely on China. Both are used to make free phone calls, chat with friends and meet new ones. WeChat has translation tools for this, while QQ does not.Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-08-08T00:00:00,Mark PhelanDetroit Free Press,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:19ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenDon’t look now, but Buick is the shape of the auto industry’s future, and that shape is an SUV.Get used to it, because as the 2021 model year hits its stride, General Motors’ oldest brand no longer has a single traditional car in its lineup.The final piece of the puzzle arrived earlier this year in the 2020 Encore GX, an appealing small SUV sure to become Buick’s best seller in a jiffy.The Encore GX completes a transition that began nearly a decade ago, when some farsighted exec recognized the approaching flood of SUVs as a rising tide that could lift a moribund brand. Buick bet on SUVs early and big, though it was easy to overlook in the early days when the Encore was the first and only premium subcompact SUV sold in the U.S.There will always be customers for sedans, coupes and convertibles, but the heart of the car market has shifted to taller vehicles with decent cargo space, commanding sightlines and available all-wheel drive.New competition for Tesla?:GM reveals all-electric Lyriq SUV critical to Cadillac's future'I'm too old to find a new career':More than half of Americans fear job lossesThe remaining question is, how many sizes and types of SUV do people want?Judging by the Encore GX, which arrived at dealerships in small numbers this year just before coronavirus blew a hole in everybody’s plans, the answer is “at least one more.”How much?The Encore GX is bigger than the Encore that’s currently Buick’s top seller. At 171.4 inches long, it’s 3 inches longer, with more passenger and cargo space. The base drivetrain is a 137-horsepower, 1.2L turbocharged three-cylinder engine linked to a continuously variable automatic transmission. That drivetrain is available only with front-wheel drive. Prices start at $24,100.An optional 1.3L three-cylinder turbo produces 155 hp. It’s a $395 option on front-drive models and standard on all-wheel-drive GXs, which also get a conventional nine-speed stepped automatic. The AWD package drive costs $2,000.The Encore GX’s size and price fit neatly between the Encore and Envision in Buick’s lineup.I tested a well-equipped FWD Encore GX Essence with the 1.3L engine and CVT. It stickered at $28,500 before options, $33,120 as tested. All prices exclude destination charges.Features on my test vehicle included:Adaptive cruise controlHead-up displayNavigation8-inch touch screenAutomatic parkingSurround vision cameras18-inch aluminum wheelsPower tailgateSatin Steel gray metallic paintBluetoothWireless chargingFront USB A & C portsRear USB A & C charging ports120-volt outletPower front seatsActive engine noise cancellationMemory for driver settingsHeated steering wheelLED head, tail and running lightsEncore GX prices will only rise about $100 when 2021 model vehicles arrive later this year. They’ll have a welcome new standard feature: wireless Apple CarPlay, which isn’t available on ‘20s. SiriusXM satellite radio will also be standard, while adaptive cruise control will be available in the safety package on the base Preferred trim level. From bottom to top, the three trim levels for an Encore GX are Preferred, Select and Essence.Encore GX prices compare well to similarly equipped models of competitors like the Audi Q3, Jeep Renegade and Lexus UX.Driving impressionsThe little 1.3L turbocharged three-cylinder delivered better performance than I expected. Acceleration was more than adequate and there’s plenty of power for fast highway cruising. My FWD model had moments of torque steer because of it generating a rather impressive 174 pound-feet of torque at just 1,600 rpm. If you prize handling, I’d recommend a test drive in an all-wheel-drive model before choosing FWD.The fuel economy penalty for adding AWD and foregoing the fuel efficient CVT is not inconsequential. The EPA rated my FWD/CVT Encore GX 30 mph in the city, 32 on the highway and 31 combined for a projected annual fuel cost of $1,050. The AWD nine-speed scored 26/29/38 for a projected cost of $1,200 at current fuel prices.Three-cylinder engines are notoriously prone to vibration. Some shake and rattle like the paint mixer at Lowe’s, but my Encore GX was smooth and quiet, thanks to its active noise cancellation and Buick’s expected emphasis on sound insulation.The Encore GX’s small size and direct steering make it easy to park and maneuver.It’s 1.7 inches shorter, four-tenths of an inch wider and as much as 1.6 inches less tall than the 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer with which it shares a platform and many systems. It is immediately recognizable as a Buick because of its unique sheet metal, LED lights, pronounced creases along its fenders and doors and a winged badge in a black grille with red highlights, part of the Sport Touring package on my test vehicle.Why did my electric bill go up? Summer's here and we're in our houses more than ever  Need Clorox wipes?

Finding your carrier’s flavor of 5G requires a taste for investigation  The Daily Money: Subscribe to our newsletterInterior comfort and controlsThe interior is roomy and quiet, with plenty of headroom, attractive vinyl upholstery and soft materials on the dash and doors. The front seat has plenty of storage cubbies and legroom. Rear legroom is acceptable, headroom in both rows is fine and there’s usable cargo space.My test car had wireless charging, but wireless CarPlay — an immensely useful feature — isn’t available on the 2020 model. It’s standard equipment for 2021.The optional technology package includes a head-up display that projects speed and other information onto a clear plastic panel that rises from the top of the instrument panel when the HUD is activated. The display is clear, but I find the costlier units that project onto the windshield more useful because they’re closer to the driver’s line of sight. People who haven’t experienced those displays may find the GX’s cost-saving approach satisfying, but I turned it off after a few miles.Contact Mark Phelan: 313-222-6731 or mmphelan@freepress.com.

",2020-08-09T00:00:00,Samuel Stebbins and Michael B. Sauter,"The public education system in the United States lags behind the schools of many wealthy nations. According to an annual study conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. trails 24 other countries – Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. among them – in student performance in core subjects. Nationwide, only about 33% of public school students about to enter high school are considered proficient in math, and 32% are considered proficient in reading, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Here is a list of the school districts where children are least likely to succeed in every state. These numbers offer a grim assessment of the general state of American schools. Encouragingly, however, there are still public schools all over the country that offer a well-rounded and high-quality education, and where student achievement is high.'I'm too old to find a new career':More than half of Americans fear job lossesGM's new SUV:All-electric Lyriq critical to Cadillac's future – and competition for Tesla24/7 Wall St. reviewed rankings for all public schools from school data clearinghouse Niche and identified the best public high school in every state. Niche’s school rating system accounts for a range of factors, including student and parent survey responses, teacher absenteeism, standardized test scores, and other measures of academic performance. A full methodological breakdown is available here. Nearly half of the schools on this list are either charter or magnet schools. Unlike regular public high schools, where place of residence is typically the only factor in enrollment, many of these schools have competitive admissions processes that are designed to select only the most motivated and talented students from both inside and outside of the school district. Unlike normal public high schools, magnet and charter schools often receive additional funding through private sources such as tuition and donations. In many non-charter or magnet schools on this list, high student achievement is often due not only to school quality, but also to advantages outside of the classroom. For example, children of better-educated parents are themselves more likely to succeed academically. The vast majority of non-charter or magnet schools on this list are located in school districts where adults and parents are far more likely to have a four-year college education than the typical American adult. These school districts also tend to be relatively wealthy. Here is a list of the most educated city in every state. Alabama: Loveless Academic Magnet Program High School• Location: Montgomery• Number of students: 513• Student-teacher ratio: 15-to-1• Avg.

McIntyre,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:000:33ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenWhen so many of the world's most successful companies were founded less than two decades ago and already have stiff competition, it seems improbable that any business can survive 100 years. Yet, some of the most successful businesses in the world continue to thrive 100 years after their foundings. Ford was founded in 1903, General Electric in 1892, AT&T in 1885 and Kroger in 1883. Each has been a Fortune 50 company at some point in the past five years. Others have been for decades.One key to survival has been adaptability, although some companies are basically in the same business as when they were founded. Kroger is still a grocery store, but it has moved from one store to hundreds. People need to shop for food, in person, just as they did over a century ago. Troubled GE was founded as an appliance company. Over the years, it evolved into a conglomerate that sold jet engines and financed other businesses.Lane Bryant closings:Here are the 150-plus Lane Bryant and Lane Bryant Outlet locations slated to liquidateAMC Theatres delays reopening again:Movies on hold during COVID-19It is important not to ignore the value of brand trust and brand loyalty. These factors are based on human judgment unlikely to change in the future. The trust in each of these brands is very high.These 10 companies will still be around in 100 years, although they may have to change their business models at least modestly.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola Co. sells several beverages, the most famous of which is Coke. It has been in business since 1886. Will it survive another 100 years? It may not sell sugar-based Coke as it does now. However, it has proven it can be adaptable. Diet Coke caters to people who want something without any calories. As people moved toward bottled water, Coke bought Dasani. It moved into the athletic drink business with Powerade. Coke has been ranked among the world's most valuable brands for decades. When people's tastes change in the future, Coke will be there with new products.JPMorganJPMorgan Chase & Co., the predecessor of which is over 100 years old, is involved in consumer banks, electronic payments, commercial banking, stock and bond trading and global finance. Will some of these businesses disappear? Almost certainly. Will the need to have some equivalent to money and a way to ""store it"" and use it for transactions be around? Yes.The argument can be made that capital like bitcoin will replace traditional banking. In some cases that may be true. However, people and institutions will still want a trusted company to be at the center of transactions. JPMorgan has built that trust over decades, and trust in financial transactions will not disappear.TeslaTesla Inc. will be in business in 100 years. Its poll position in electric cars and autonomous vehicles will be part of the reason. Its unique ability to adapt will be its cornerstone. Like Ford, it will take its brand through decades of evolution, even if cars become flying modes of transportation or they can travel thousands of miles. Tesla is the Ford, GM and Toyota together as the personal transportation devices change, perhaps several times over several decades.Tesla:Electric car maker picks Austin, Texas area as site for second US vehicle assembly plantPour by phone:Coca-Cola introduces contactless technology to pour your beverageFacebookFacebook Inc. is at the center of global personal communication with nearly 2 million members, an impressive percentage of the world's population. It is hard to believe that people will migrate to another platform because Facebook has such a substantial lead in social media. Will Facebook allow people to meet one another personally? Perhaps. Will Facebook become the leader in an advanced form of telecommunication? Almost certainly. Will anyone catch its web of members who already have placed their personal information online and have a web of friends? Unlikely.Berkshire HathawayBerkshire Hathaway Inc. has the advantage of being a conglomerate, an advantage GE had for decades. The key to a strong conglomerate is the ability to pick the best businesses to own or invest in. Those skills are unlikely to disappear as part of global business.Will Berkshire Hathaway, originally, a clothing company, be able to change substantially? The skills to employ capital to own companies will not go away. Berkshire's investment in railroads eventually will disappear. Its ownership of real estate sales and insurance may not. Its DNA, however, is owning large parts of other firms, like Apple, Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz, and that will remain. It is, in essence, a skill for deploying capital.Why did my electric bill go up?

People may not need these devices. However, Apple has what it calls an ""ecosystem"" of people loyal to its brands, products and services. This system has hundreds of millions of members. Apple caters to its demand for media, cloud computing and financial transactions. The army of loyal customers will be hard to replace by brands to which people have less loyalty.AmazonLike Apple, Amazon.com Inc. has hundreds of millions of members. It also has three powerful businesses. The first is e-commerce. There is a strong argument people will not buy goods online and have them shipped. However, people will need to have a system for buying and delivering. Amazon may own an advanced version of that system.Two other Amazon businesses are likely to survive. The first is artificial intelligence-based communications methods and devices. Amazon's lead with this today is its Alexa-powered software. Amazon has had a skill for being in the lead in essential software. Amazon's cloud storage business also likely will survive and evolve, as people and businesses want to store data in protected and remote locations.MastercardLike JPMorgan, Mastercard Inc. is already in the business of the safe movement and storage of capital. It has evolved into an electronic means of payment. Once, again, trust and a history of secure transactions will continue to be a factor of transactions well into the future. And Mastercard has a network of hundreds of millions of vendors already plugged into its systems. One of Mastercard's other advantages is its ability to handle employee transactions for multinational companies.The New York TimesThe New York Times Co. may be the most trusted medium in America, particularly in a world dominated by fake news. Its entire staff of reporters has two jobs. One is to collect facts. The other is to confirm them. The value of these will not disappear in the future. This company is already over 100 years old, and it has morphed its means of communication over time. As the use of physical papers has declined, The New York Times has moved online. Its 5 million online subscribers are likely the largest number of any medium in America.AirbnbAirbnb is at the heart of the business of finding locations with trusted owners, rented by trusted renters. This screening system will evolve and become more trusted. However, the market for people who want to use real estate that they do not own is unlikely to go away. The key to examining these locations may become virtual. The means of payment may become virtual as well.

",2020-07-23T00:00:00,Mike SniderUSA TODAY,"AT&T says its 5G network now is officially nationwide.The wireless provider Thursday announced 5G coverage reaching 395 markets across the U.S. covering 205 million people.AT&T hoped to achieve nationwide coverage during the first half of the year, but the coronavirus crisis pushed back its plans slightly. As of last month, AT&T's reach was 355 markets and 179 million people.AT&T has achieved its coverage with a mix of 5G technology. Super-fast millimeter wave signals, which can be five times the speed of current 4G signals, are available in parts of 35 markets, the company says. Making up the rest of the network are so-called ""sub-6 GHz"" signals, which travel farther and provide more reliable, robust coverage but deliver speeds similar to current connections.TVs stay hot:Despite coronavirus pandemic, consumers still turned on by big-screen televisionsT is for Texas ... and Tesla:Tesla picks Austin, Texas area as site for second US vehicle assembly plantThe rollout of 5G networks has been more than three years in the making and been accompanied by plenty of hype. But the true promise of 5G connectivity – widespread ultra-fast, low latency connections everywhere – remains a work in progress. ""This is the starting point, not the end point,"" said Gordon Mansfield, AT&T's vice president for mobility and access architecture. ""This new network will continue to evolve to introduce new experiences that are possible to be delivered with 5G.""You can check AT&T's 5G coverage for your region on att.com.As consumers opt for new 5G smartphones and other devices and 5G networks expand their reach and robustness, app developers will begin to focus on projects that take advantage of the standard's improved capacity, reliability and speed, Mansfield says.AT&T's competitors are helping drive 5G along, too. Competitor T-Mobile laid claim to completing a nationwide 5G network in December 2019. Having merged with Sprint in April, T-Mobile now says its 5G network reaches nearly 6,000 cities and 225 million people. And Verizon has 5G wireless availability in parts of 35 cities across the U.S., and 5G home service available in six cities.But always-connected everywhere 5G signals are still being constructed. Eventually, carriers will combine various channels to deliver better connectivity. ""It's kind of like going from a one-lane road to adding a few more lanes and all of a sudden traffic gets to go faster,"" said Bob O'Donnell, the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research and a USA TODAY technology columnist. ""This is sort of the completion of the one-lane road, so to speak.""As that construction continues, consumers may have to decide when it comes time to buy a new smartphone whether they want to ""future proof"" their phone, O'Donnell said.Even though you won't be able to experience all of 5G's capabilities for some time, ""over time it will get better and if you buy a 5G phone now the benefit is your phone will get better without you having to buy a new phone,"" he said.Beginning Aug. 7, AT&T is adding 5G access to its AT&T Unlimited Starter wireless plan, which starts at $35 monthly for four lines. That's the same prices as AT&T's current plan; other wireless plans including AT&T Unlimited Elite (which also comes with HBO Max) can add 5G for no additional cost, too. Among the 5G phones available from AT&T: a 5G version of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip ($1,449.99, available Aug. 7) and the LG Velvet smartphone (starting at $10 monthly on a 30-month payment plan and new AT&T Unlimited plan).Why did my electric bill go up?

It is expected to hit U.S. dealerships in the second half of 2021.Unlike when Nissan debuted the Leaf electric car to much fanfare in 2010, the Ariya is entering an increasingly crowded marketplace amid lingering questions about whether Americans are willing to embrace electric vehicles.The Ariya's most direct competitors include the Tesla Model Y, a crossover variant of the Chevrolet Bolt, the Kia Niro and the electric version of the Hyundai Kona. More are on their way.The vehicle, which was revealed Wednesday in Japan, marks Nissan's bid to recapture the interest of electric car enthusiasts, who have largely gravitated to Tesla in recent years despite Nissan's initial leadership in the EV space. The Ford Bronco is back:Ford reveals 2021 Bronco SUV, Bronco SportCan shopping malls survive?:New store closings threaten malls amid pandemicAshwani Gupta, Nissan's global chief operating officer, called the Ariya ""the flagship"" for Nissan's growing electric car lineup.

""This is not a simple EV – it is much more than an EV.""The Ariya is also ""much more than (the) Leaf"" due to its features, he said, including the driving experience, longer battery range and safety systems.""I'm not saying this is a cheap price, but this is a great price for the value proposition,"" he said.The Ariya comes with a more advanced version of Nissan's ProPilot Assist technology, which enables hands-free steering on the highway.The two-row, five-passenger vehicle enters the market as Tesla is ramping up production of its new Model Y crossover, which is built on the same platform as its hit Model 3 compact car.""They are really making impressive cars, no doubt about it,"" Gupta said.Still, he said Nissan plans to expand the Ariya's technologies and design into other models.Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey",tesla,usatoday,,

Troise,"PlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:39ADSKIPOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenWall Street extended its recent run of gains Tuesday, despite a late stumble that nearly wiped out the stock market’s gains for the day.The S&P 500 rose 0.2% after having been up 0.8% in the early going. Banks and energy companies led the gains, outweighing losses in technology stocks, which pulled the Nasdaq composite lower. Small company stocks did better than the broader market.The latest gains followed strength in markets overseas as investors welcomed news that European leaders have agreed on a budget and coronavirus relief fund worth more than $2 trillion. The agreement comes as pressure intensifies on Congress and the White House to reach a deal on another economic aid package before a temporary boost in aid for unemployed Americans expires at the end of the month.There are two COVID Americas:One hopes for an extension of federal unemployment and stimulus. The other is saving and spending.Moment of truth:Some homeowners expect struggle to pay mortgage when extra unemployment endsHope for more economic aid from the government, following Europe’s example, helped put investors in a buying mood Tuesday, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist for Invesco.“The U.S. does not have the safety net that Europe has,” she said. “This is an environment in which there is going to be a need for more fiscal stimulus or you could see real hit to consumers.”The S&P 500 gained 5.46 points to 3,257.30. It was the index’s third-straight gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 159.53 points, or 0.6%, to 26,840.40. The Nasdaq dropped 86.73 points, or 0.8%, to 10,680.36, a day after notching its best day since the end of April and its latest all-time high.Small company stocks surged, driving the Russell 2000 index up 19.56 points, or 1.3%, to 1,487.51. Indexes in Europe and Asia closed higher.Treasury yields were mostly lower and the price of gold rose 1.5%, signs of continuing caution in the market.After following up a 20% drop in the first three months of the year with a nearly 20% gain over the April-June quarter, Wall Street has continued its winning ways so far in July. The S&P 500 has notched a weekly gain the past three weeks as investors cheered improvements in hiring, retail sales and other parts of the economy, along with rising hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine.The Federal Reserve’s efforts to support markets and expectations that Washington will deliver more financial aid to help Americans weather the economic downturn have been key in keeping markets mostly pushing higher since stocks plunged in March.The overall S&P 500 index has rallied back to within 3.9% of its record set in February and is back to where it was in early June.Still, worries remain that the rise of coronavirus counts across much of the country will derail efforts to reopen businesses shut down due to the pandemic. That’s why Wall Street is betting on Washington to deliver another trillion-dollar round of economic aid.“We still have areas of the U.S. that have become hotspots, there are localized lockdowns and we expect the employment landscape will not be able to heal until we have the economy open completely,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The larger the (aid) package, the more it will continue to cushion the downside ramifications of the epidemic.”Energy companies were the biggest gainers among the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, by far, as the price of oil headed higher, an encouraging sign that markets hope economies will continue to recover. Occidental Petroleum led all other stocks in the S&P 500, vaulting nearly 11%. More than a dozen other energy companies also moved sharply higher.Technology stocks and companies that rely on consumer spending, sectors that are up the most this year, gave up some of their gains after powering a rally a day earlier.The rise in financial, energy and industrial stocks is a reversal in the market’s prevailing trend since the pandemic struck, which has been to favor companies that benefit from Americans largely stuck at home and increasingly relying upon technology, digital communication and e-commerce.“Today you’re also seeing small-cap names move up at the expense of the tech names,” Krosby said.Investors also had their eye on the latest batch of quarterly report cards from companies. Coca-Cola rose 2.3% and Philip Morris International gained 4.2% after the companies reported earnings in the latest quarter that beat analysts’ forecasts.Among the other big companies reporting results this week: Microsoft and Tesla issue results on Wednesday, Intel, AT&T and Twitter report on Thursday and Verizon Communications and American Express report earnings Friday.The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.59% from 0.61% late Monday. The yield is a benchmark for interest rates on mortgages and other consumer loans.In the commodities markets, the price of benchmark U.S oil rose 2.8% to settle at $41.96 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 2.4% to close at $44.32 a barrel.",tesla,usatoday,,

Many have lost loved ones. Many are struggling. Many feel sad, scared, frustrated and broken.""It’s OK to not be OK right now and to just do your best to get through this truly unprecedented time,"" C. Vaile Wright, director of clinical research and quality at the American Psychological Association, told USA TODAY earlier this year.But while this year seems especially hard, there are silver linings. Out of coronavirus comes creativity. Out of quarantine comes bonus time with family. Out of activism comes changes for the better.One thing we can try to do is to see the good. Maybe this list will help. From small acts of kindness to new albums that got us dancing, here are 100 good things that happened in 2020 so far, compiled by USA TODAY's Life staff, in no particular order. A 103-year-old grandma beat COVID-19 and celebrated with a Bud Light.Drive-in movie theaters made a comeback.Drive-in concerts are a thing now (which is great news for those missing live music, or those who don’t like crowds anyway).We got to watch football greats Tom Brady and Peyton Manning play golf with golf greats Phil Mickleson and Tiger Woods in ""The Match"" for COVID-19 relief.Tom Brady ripped his pants.

Then she got engaged.People got creative about reimagined vacations, including our own staff.Americans rushed to adopt and foster pets in need amid the pandemic.Sure, we might have gained a little weight, but we rediscovered our love for old hobbies like baking and gardening.And when it comes to baking, we got really creative by turning tiny pancakes into cereal and so much more.We also have time to read again and we're seizing the moment to educate ourselves: books like Robin DiAngelo's ""White Fragility"" and Ibram X. Kendi's ""How to Be an Antiracist"" have topped USA TODAY's best-selling books list for weeks.Puzzles and board games became cool again and offered a much-needed break from our screens. There are even games you can play over Zoom!Your favorite Disney Channel stars from childhood had major glow-up moments after overcoming challenges.TikTok blew up and our boredom was cured (well, at least some of our time during quarantine was filled learning dances and watching endless hours of these short videos).Also, TikTok gave us Tabitha Brown who soothes us with her calming voice and motivational speeches.

And we learn more about who got federal loans for their businesses, and they include folks linked to lawmakers Devin Nunes and Nancy Pelosi. Plus, I love a good comeback story, so let's start with that. It's Arlene Martínez with stories from up and down the coast this Tuesday.But first, a man's racist remarks to an Asian family at a Carmel Valley restaurant sparked outrage, including from singer Kelly Clarkson.In California brings you top stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Sign up here for M-F delivery right to your inbox. After 50 years, California condors soar in Sequoia National ParkAt one time they were nearly extinct, but this spring, endangered California condors were spotted in Sequoia National Park for the first time in nearly 50 years. The vultures were observed atop the towering granite dome of Moro Rock in late May, the National Park Service said Tuesday; others fitted with GPS transmitters were tracked flying around Giant Forest.Condors, which are scavengers, almost died out in large part due to ingesting lead in the carcasses of animals shot by hunters.In the early 1980s, all 22 birds remaining in the wild were trapped and brought into a captive-breeding program that began releasing condors into Southern California's Los Padres National Forest in 1992. Today, there are about 340 birds in the wild. Twentynine Palms' shooter; the Golden State Killer's deal; a plea to Newsom  A Marine on Tuesday was transported to a Palm Springs hospital for a self-inflicted gunshot wound following reports of an ""active shooter"" at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms.The Golden State Killer pleaded guilty to everything he was charged with and admitted to crimes that had long passed the statute of limitations. Because of the latter, 87 living and willing victims will get the chance to share their trauma.More than 60 state and local leaders, along with upwards of 100 advocacy groups, are calling on Gov. Gavin Newsom to stop transferring immigrants who have been released from jails and prisons to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the coronavirus pandemic.Christopher Columbus has exited the buildingCrews carried out a statue of Christopher Columbus from the center of the Capitol rotunda on Tuesday, roughly 137 years after it was first placed there. It’s the latest statue of Columbus and other colonial figures to be toppled or taken down in the United States and beyond, following the uproar over racism after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Baltimore protesters threw a statue of the Italian navigator into the city’s harbor over the weekend.Columbus, once depicted in U.S. classrooms as a globe-trotting explorer and ""discoverer"" of America, was actually more of a ruthless and violent figure who enslaved indigenous populations and worse, historical documents show.This statue depicts Columbus appealing to Queen Isabella I, who financed his voyage to the New World in 1492 that set off European colonization of the Americas.Masks, unemployment, travel and taxesCan your company require you to wear a mask?

Cases quadrupled there in the last month.Law enforcement in Los Angeles has to wear face masks just like everyone else. Not all of them are.More than half of Riverside County's 20,000+ coronavirus cases are in people younger than 40.Companies linked to Nunes, Pelosi received PPP moneyMore than 60,000 businesses across the country received between $150,000 and $10 million each through the federal Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to help small businesses keep their doors open during the coronavirus pandemic. At least 60% of the loan had to be used for payroll costs in order to be forgiven.On Monday, the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department released the names of recipients, which USA TODAY Network reporters have been busily analyzing and sorting. Here's some of what they found:Wineries partly owned by Congressman Devin Nunes, R-Tulare County, received between $1 million and $2 million.EDI Associates in San Rafael, a firm linked to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, received a loan between $350,000 and $1 million. A Pelosi spokesperson told USA TODAY that Paul Pelosi was ""a minor, passive investor"" with an 8.1% stake in the firm and ""was not involved in or even aware of this PPP loan.”Lobbying and policy group Waxman Strategies, which is run by former Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, and his son Michael Waxman, received a loan of between $350,000 and $1 million.What else we're talking aboutThe Contra Costa County District Attorney's office on Tuesday charged two people with a hate crime for defacing a Black Lives Matter mural in Martinez.Affordable housing organizations prepare for a wave of evictions and homelessness. Tesla's valuation has added the combined value of GM, Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler in just five trading days through Monday — on average, it's grown by $14 billion on each of those days.California's just-passed 2020-21 budget allocates three times more per resident than in 1990-91, even adjusted for inflation, yet residents continue to get less and less in return (Commentary).Overachieving in a pandemic might just be overrated, writes Inland Valley Daily Bulletin columnist David Allen. I'll leave you today with an event to put on your calendar: On Thursday at 5 p.m. PT, join USA TODAY's Storytellers Project LIVE, In Your House! for ""Kids Stories,"" a show for adults about childhood and children.It's on Facebook and YouTube, so skip the Zoom fatigue. In California brings you top news and analysis from across USA TODAY Network newsrooms. Also contributing: Bloomberg, San Diego Union-Tribune, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Associated Press, Fox KTVU, LAist.Enjoying this newsletter?

",2020-06-24T00:00:00,Nathan BomeyUSA TODAY,"Sometimes, more luxury means more problems.While their sumptuous interiors, premium handling and high-tech powertrains might be worth paying for, luxury vehicles are still losing ground to mainstream cars when it comes to basic quality, according to a new industry survey.The 2020 J.D. Power Initial Quality Study, an annual benchmark that is considered highly influential in vehicle purchases, found that only three luxury brands topped the industry average for problems per vehicle: Hyundai Motor Group's Genesis, Toyota's Lexus and General Motors' Cadillac.Save better, spend better:Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up hereThe rest – including Tesla, which had the worst score of any brand – are all below average, in part because ""premium brands generally equip their vehicles with more complex technology, which can cause problems for some owners,"" according to J.D. Power.What's more, the quality of mainstream brands has improved greatly in recent years. In this year's survey, four mainstream brands took the top slots in the survey: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Dodge, Hyundai Motor Group's Kia, GM's Chevrolet and FCA's Ram.The highest-ranked model in this year's survey was the Chevrolet Sonic, a subcompact car.Hyundai Motor Group, whose brands include Genesis, Hyundai and Kia, had the most vehicles top their segments for highest quality with seven. GM had six, BMW had three, Ford Motor had three and Nissan had three.To be sure, ranking high on quality doesn't necessarily translate into popularity. Many Americans buy vehicles for other reasons, including styling, fuel efficiency, power, utility and status. The quality of the Chevy Sonic, for example, has not translated into a boost at the dealership. Sonic sales fell 32% to 13,971 vehicles in 2019 as Americans continued to lose interest in small cars.13 more J.C.

But it earned the worst score of any brand rated by J.D. Power, with an average of 250 problems per 100 vehicles. J.D. Power said Tesla's electric vehicle systems perform well, but the brand struggles with other problems, such as paint quality, wind noise, rattling and body panel fit and finish, among other things.J.D. Power said it is not officially including Tesla in its rankings since the company did not provide permission for it to survey Tesla owners in 15 states where it is required. But J.D. Power still scored the company based on surveys of owners in the other 35 states. That score trailed the worst-officially ranked brand, Land Rover.The 34th annual survey, conducted from February through May, assessed the performance of 2020 model-year vehicles within 90 days after they were sold. It included 223 questions and 87,272 vehicles.Here's how the J.D.

As with that pickup, the 2021 F-150’s body is made of aluminum. Its frame is fully boxed high-strength steel.The F-150’s dimensions are virtually unchanged, except for a slightly wider track.Ford promises best-in-class power and towing capability. Figures, including price, will be available closer to when sales start later this year.Why 2021 truck is different:Redesigned Ford F-150 pickup revealedChapter 11 filing:Chuck E. Cheese, Peter Piper Pizza parent company for bankruptcy protectionProduction will begin shortly at Ford’s sprawling Rouge complex in Michigan, followed by a second plant outside Kansas City, Missouri.High on the list of features F-150 owners should like:Hybrid model doubles as a generatorA hybrid model that goes on sale later this year will double as a generator that produces 2.4 to 7.2 kilowatts — enough to power a worksite full of tools, a deluxe campsite or your house in a blackout. The generator also can charge tools while you drive.The hybrid uses a twin-turbo 3.5-liter, 6-cylinder, 35-kilowatt electric motor and a suitcase-sized lithium-ion battery bolted to the frame under the cab. The hybrid will be available on crew cab F-150s in all trim levels.Ford also will offer a generator option on non-hybrid F-150s.Sleeper seatsThe optional Max Recline front seats on King Ranch, Platinum and Limited models fold 180 degrees flat, and adjust their cushions for reasonably comfortable naps.Hands-free highway drivingThe F-150 goes Tesla one better with hands-free highway driving, a feature thus far offered only by Cadillac luxury vehicles. Available with an over-the-air software update to properly equipped F-150s next summer, the system will work on more than 100,000 miles of divided highways in the U.S. and Canada. (Tesla’s Autopilot requires the driver’s hands on the steering wheel for safety.)At least initially, the system will not function while the vehicle is towing a trailer.New lookThe F-150 will offer 11 grille styles, raised front fenders and tucked-in doors for a distinctive stance. Standard active grille shutters will boost fuel efficiency, and an active front air dam will lower at 40 mph, retracting partially at lower speeds and completely for off-roading.C-clamp-style running lights should make the F-150 easy to recognize.Ford will offer 13 wheels, from 17 to 22 inches.Big screen, flag-waving interiorA 12-inch touch screen will be standard on models accounting for more than 50% of sales, everything above the XLT Lux. Ford says it believes the tablet-size screen’s landscape orientation will be better suited to vehicles than the upright portrait orientation the Ram pickup uses. An 8-inch touch screen will be standard on lower models. The F-150 retains easy-to-use dials — bigger to accommodate work gloves — for volume, tuning, fan and temperature.A pair of etched-chrome U.S. flags on the side of the instrument panel will greet occupants when the door is open. The XLT model also will have a map of Detroit appliqué on its inner door panels.Work-friendly cab and tailgateF-150 cabs will feature a wide center console sized to accommodate laptops. The gear shifter folds down into the console, creating enough room to put your laptop down, instead of balancing  it on your knee as in other pickups. F-150s with bench seats get a column-mounted shifter and a fold-down center console that’s also sized to accommodate a laptop.A lockable storage bin under the rear seat is available. It stows to create a flat-load floor for large objects.The tailgate incorporates a few simple, work-friendly changes. Its inner surface has a built-in ruler, pockets for pens and is lighted for paperwork. Other pockets are designed to accommodate C-clamps, while tailgate-mounted cleats can double as bottle openers.  Follow Detroit Free Press auto critic Mark Phelan on Twitter @mark_phelan.",tesla,usatoday,,

That pickup, the Endurance, made its debut Thursday, carrying the hopes of a region keen to hold onto its manufacturing base at a time of particular uncertainty, with an economy struggling to regain its footing amid the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.Layoffs:1.48M workers file for unemployment amid COVID-19 signaling slow recoveryTop vehicles:These are the 26 highest-quality cars, trucks, SUVs of 2020, according to J.D. PowerPence, however, spread a positive message, saying the country is on the rebound after being hit by the worst pandemic in a hundred years.“America’s coming back,” Pence announced at one point. “The recovery is on.”Pence, who chose not to wear a face mask, noted his role in helping lead the country’s coronavirus response, which has faced withering criticism from some amid a mounting death toll and rapid spread in the South and West. Pence said that it was the president’s decisive action early on that had bought vital time. Pence said that he would be traveling to Texas and Arizona in the coming days to meet officials there.Why did my electric bill go up?

Finding your carrier’s flavor of 5G requires a taste for investigation  The Daily Money: Subscribe to our newsletterAside from noting that the economy had been roaring before the pandemic, with low unemployment for African-Americans and Hispanics, and ticking off other accomplishments on trade and relations with China, Pence emphasized Lordstown and its people:“The best days in Lordstown and Ohio and America are yet to come.”“Endurance isn’t just the name of the pickup truck, endurance describes the character of the people of the Mahoning Valley.”Pence rode inside as the silver truck, with black strips and orange and black wheels, drove onto the stage. The truck, a prototype ahead of next year’s expected production version, acted as backdrop as Pence emphasized a future for Lordstown, which once employed 5,000 workers.And highlighting what is a unique relationship many Americans have with their pickups, a crucially profitable piece of auto sales, Pence noted that he’s a truck guy. Truck owners are a key demographic for Trump’s reelection hopes. Incidentally, Thursday is also the day Ford unveils its new F-150.The fate of the plant had been a key focus ahead of GM/UAW contract talks last year, and frustration with the automaker’s decision to walk away has been a concern not just for labor but also among Ohio’s political establishment. However, Business Insider reported recently that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said the state would rather focus on creating jobs than trying to claw back $60 million in public subsidies GM had received. Lordstown Motors Founder and CEO Steve Burns said GM did his company a great service by leaving the massive plant intact.More:GM’s former plant in Lordstown will return to mass vehicle production, thousands of jobsMore:Cars.com says Ford Ranger beats Jeep Cherokee in American-Made Index“That was a big ask, but they did it,” he said.The plant could produce 400,000 Cruzes per year, but Burns said in the future the plant could potentially make 600,000 trucks. And as soon as next year, assuming production is under way, four hundred assembly line workers and hundreds of other workers and engineers could be employed.Lordstown Motors is working against time, with several other companies developing their own electric trucks, but the Endurance is geared toward fleet customers. Raising hopes for the success of the Endurance, however, are 14,000 pre-orders. Burns said the plant and its surrounding area have the potential to become the “electrification hub of the Midwest,” and maybe the country.As for the truck itself, Burns indicated it would impress.The Endurance base price is $52,500, before counting the $7,500 federal tax credit. The company promises a range of at least 250 miles per charge. The truck is powered by four in-wheel hub motors, which Burns said should give it good traction in muddy conditions and mean few moving parts to wear out, and it claims up to 600 horsepower and towing capacity of 7,500 pounds.Burns described the dash area as minimalistic, with a screen as well as knobs because fleet customers say their drivers might be wearing gloves.“It’s a pickup truck that handles like a sports car. It’s a reinvention. We are hitting (the market) at the exact right time,” he said.Follow Eric D. Lawrence on Twitter: @_ericdlawrence.How to stage a good video meeting?

",2020-06-22T00:00:00,Adam Shell,"When the economy hits a slow patch, seeking shelter in pockets of the stock market where companies can still grow their earnings has long been a go-to investment strategy.The reason is simple: How much money a company earns is one of the key drivers of stock price performance. So, with the U.S. economy in a recession for the first time since 2009, and the Federal Reserve projecting that the nation’s GDP will decline 6.5% in 2020 and the unemployment rate will end the year at 9.3%, portfolio managers covet growth more than ever.Indeed, the more insulated a company’s sales and profit streams are from economic woes, the more likely it is that their stock will perform better relative to companies whose profits suffer more during slowdowns.Growth, it turns out, is good, and is viewed as a type of safety play on Wall Street.Will Main Street lending work? Can the Fed's Main Street loan program save midsize companies during COVID-19 crisis?Buddy, can you spare a dim:National coin shortage: Pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters part of latest COVID-19 shortage“Safety is viewed through the lens of consistency of earnings growth, and not volatility of earnings,” says Joe Fath, manager of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock fund.The attributes these types of companies share are similar no matter what type of business or industry they are in.“What we’re looking for is a company that can grow no matter what,” says Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta. “They are in the right spot in their industry versus their competitors. They have a competitive advantage, some sort of lead or moat. They will be taking market share rather than losing share.”When it comes to generating steady earnings through both good and bad times, some industry groups tend to hold up better than others. Some examples include:TechnologyTech, known for innovation, productivity-boosting software and must-have apps that transform the way people live, work and communicate, is lauded for its growth characteristics. In the first quarter of 2020, tech stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 grew earnings 7%, compared with a drop of nearly 13% for the broad index. In the current quarter, which ends June 30, tech profits are seen declining 8.5%, versus a nearly 43% contraction for the S&P 500.Companies in the tech space are disruptors and drive societal trends with staying power. They’re at the forefront of long-term shifts, such as the pivot to a digital world, working from home, socializing and newsgathering on smartphones, shopping online, streaming TV content, and storing reams of data in the cloud.And being at the center of those trends creates demand for their products no matter what the broader economy is doing.Used-car deals:How to hunt down a used-car deal from a rental company like Hertz, Enterprise during coronavirus“Tech is the easy place to go or hide out regardless of what’s happening in the economy,” says David Reyes, founder and chief financial architect at Reyes Financial Architecture in San Diego.He cites a company such as Zoom, a leader in online videoconferencing, a growing trend as the adoption of remote working and online worker collaboration gains a greater foothold in the economy.“It’s a company that is economically agnostic,” Reyes says. “People will need to communicate via the web regardless of how the economy is doing. It’s a perfect example of a non-cyclical stock, or one that is not reliant on employment or GDP.”Zoom’s shares, though, already have a lot of good news built into its share price following a spike in usage during the recent economic shutdown.If there’s a downside to tech now, however, it’s that the group has had a stellar run and many of its popular stocks have had big run-ups, such as Zoom, Tesla and payment giants Visa and MasterCard. That’s why T. Rowe Price’s Fath is recommending tech stocks positioned in fast-growing areas that are selling at more reasonable prices relative to their earnings.One less well-known play in the mobile pay space, for example, that is benefiting from the long-term shift away from people using paper money is Fiserv (FISV). The stock, which was among the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock fund’s top 20 holdings as of March 31, is trading at a much more reasonable valuation despite being a “very steady grower” and “relatively economically resistant,” Fath says.Still, many emerging tech trends are just beginning their penetration into markets.“Is cybersecurity going away? No,” says GLOBALT’s Martin. “Is cloud computing going away? No.”Communications ServicesSince this group of stocks was realigned in 2018, growth names like video streaming service Netflix, search-engine Google’s parent Alphabet and social media giant Facebook are now in the lineup. The good news is stocks like Facebook and Google not only benefit from durable earnings growth but now trade at a reasonable price relative to their earnings, Fath says.Companies like Netflix, which GLOBALT’s Thomas says are on the “forward-looking side of change”, also tend to grow faster than the overall market during periods of economic softness.Health careThe need for knee replacements, medical diagnostics and surgeries doesn’t go down just because the economy isn’t firing on all cylinders. Increasingly, health care, too, is being driven by technological breakthroughs and apps that drive growth, Fath says. The use of robotics, for example, is powering the joint replacement surgery business of Stryker (SYK). And so-called telehealth services offered by companies like Teladoc Health (TDOC), which enable patients to consult with their doctors virtually, is also in a growth sweet spot.“We’re in the early days,” Fath says about virtual medical treatment. “You’ll see more innovation” and greater usage over time.UtilitiesEarnings of companies that provide everyday services like electricity also tend to hold up better when the economy slows, says Reyes, who advises investors to own stocks in sectors that will provide stability in tough times. In the current second quarter, utilities companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see just a 3.3% drop in earnings, vs. a 40%-plus drop for the broader index.Reyes points out that when economic growth slows, interest rates tend to fall as well. That makes higher-yielding stocks with steady earnings like utilities a good place to park some capital, he says. The current yield on the 10-year Treasury note is around 0.70%, far below the 3.5% average yield of utilities stocks in the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Similarly, companies that sell staples like cereal and toilet tissue, Reyes says, also have historically seen their profits remain firm despite softness in the economy.Reyes also says that investors should also be on the lookout for an eventual economic upswing. Buying stocks that benefit from a rebounding economy can be profitable if the purchases coincide with stronger growth. His favorite pick is so-called small-cap value stocks, or smaller companies whose shares are undervalued.“When we come out of recession, typically small-company stocks will outperform,” Reyes says. “Small company stocks have lagged bigger stocks this year, so may also benefit from playing catchup.”",tesla,usatoday,,

The benchmark index had briefly climbed 0.5% following the release of the central bank’s latest policy statement.Most sectors finished lower, but a surge in technology sector stocks helped push the Nasdaq above 10,000 for the first time, giving the index its third record high close in a row. Bond yields were broadly lower, reflecting caution among investors.The Fed has cut its benchmark short-term rate to near zero as part of a historic effort to gird the stock market and U.S. economy from the coronavirus pandemic’s economic ravages.Will your local Starbucks close?:Coffee giant says it will close 400 stores but expanding pickup optionsEvictions expected to spike:Actions come as states end moratoriums that offered relief during COVID-19The central bank made clear Wednesday that it will keep providing support by buying bonds to maintain low borrowing rates. It also forecast no rate hike through 2022, which could make it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend enough to sustain an economy depressed by business shutdowns and high unemployment.The move to leave its key interest rate unchanged wasn’t a surprise to investors, but the fact that nearly all of the members of the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee foresee no rate hike through 2022 was noteworthy, said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen.“What you have on the FOMC is unanimity that rates ought to stay low and that their communication should continue to emphasize that they’re not going to raise interest rates, absent a material improvement in the economy,” he said.The combination of low interest rates and low inflation has been a key driver for gains in big technology companies that can grow almost regardless of the economy.“That’s been the magic formula for growth stocks,” Nick said.The S&P 500 dropped 17.04 points to 3,190.14.

Employers added 2.5 million workers to their payrolls, when economists were expecting them instead to slash another 8 million jobs.But in remarks during a virtual news conference Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the May jobs data, while encouraging, was hardly enough to ensure that the job market or the economy is back on track.“The labor market may have hit bottom in May,” Powell said. But, he added, “we’re not going to overreact to a single data point.”Airlines were among the big decliners Wednesday after Delta Air Lines warned in a regulatory filing that it expects its revenue in the second quarter to be down 90% from a year earlier. Delta fell 7.4%, American Airlines dropped 8.2% and Alaska Air Group lost 10%.Two of the nation’s biggest mall owners fell sharply after Simon Property Group backed out of its $3.6 billion takeover of rival Taubman Centers. The buyout deal was signed in February, just before the pandemic began to spread in the U.S. Simon Property slid 4%, while Taubman plunged 20.1%.Shares in electric car and solar panel maker Tesla closed above $1,000 for the first time, climbing 9% to $1,025.05. The stock also closed at a new high on Monday. Tesla shares have more than doubled so far this year.Bond yields fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield slid to 0.72% from 0.82% late Tuesday. It tends to move with investors’ expectations of the economy and inflation, though it’s still well above the 0.64% level where it started last week.Oil prices rose. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery rose 1.7% to settle at $39.60 a barrel. Brent crude oil for August delivery rose 1.3% to $41.73 a barrel.European indexes closed broadly lower, while Asian markets ended mixed.The pullback in global stocks came as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the coronavirus crisis has triggered the worst global recession in nearly a century and projected that the global economy will shrink by 6% this year in a best-case scenario, with only a modest pick-up next year.The estimate, which is based on an analysis of the latest global economic data, suggests an even sharper decline of 7.6% if there is a second wave of coronavirus contagions this year.Why did my electric bill go up?

When it comes to the leadership of law enforcement's powerful unions, they're even whiter. The head of the Los Angeles police union is white, as are those who lead unions in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., New Orleans and Houston. And California’s statewide Fraternal Order of Police appears to have all white-leadership (and a black chaplain).  “It is to the detriment of policing, period, that our community is not represented at police union tables,” Sonia Pruitt, chairwoman of the National Black Police Association, an advocacy group for black cops, told The Marshall Project. “If they had leaders who said, ‘Listen, what happened to George Floyd was absolutely terrible,’ officers around the country would follow.”►Golden State news straight to your inbox. Our California newsletter is here. The Simi Valley Police Department and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department join a growing list of agencies that will stop using a controversial neck restraint called a carotid hold. The restraint restricts blood flow to the brain, sometimes causing the person to pass out. For years, it has been part of the use-of-force manual for police departments throughout the county and state.Riverside County took its action a day after a failed attempt by an elected official to launch a review of the department's policies. Calling it dangerous, California Assemblymember Mike A. Gipson, D-Carson, has proposed legislation to eliminate its use. Last Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state to stop training officers to use the hold.Starbucks plans closures, Disneyland announces reopenings and gym lifeStarbucks is closing up to 400 of its stores but opening hundreds of others that make it easier to grab and go. Disneyland and California Adventure will begin a phased reopening on July 17.

Some just won't go.COVID-19's implications at the borderThe Trump administration expelled 2,175 unaccompanied minors between March 21 and June 2, citing the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to release a breakdown of their ages. On a related note, the ACLU on Wednesday filed a suit challenging the Trump administration's decision to block many migrants from entering the country — including those requesting asylum — in the name of public health.San Diego police department, buoyed by huge raises, increases budgetDespite pleas by some residents to cut funding during a 10-hour meeting, San Diego city leaders boosted police spending by $27 million for the fiscal year that starts July 1.That brings the total spending to $566 million, budget documents show.The systemic, generational issues that need to be addressed won't be solved in a single budget, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer told USA TODAY in a statement. ""We’re going to keep funding our police department but it won’t be business as usual.""Last week, Faulconer banned the use of the carotid restraint by police officers, and he said he supports a ballot measure to increase independent oversight of the agency.The city's rising police costs can in part be attributed to double-digit pay raises in recent years. Higher salaries in turn lead to higher pension payments — employee compensation is not surprisingly a department's biggest cost.In 2018, officers were given raises totaling 25.6% by the time the last increase kicked in on Jan 1, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Officers with 20 or more years got 30.6%. Officers also get extra pay for working night shifts, having a degree, longevity pay and other factors.And unlike many departments that are part of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), San Diego officers still have ""3 at 55"" which means they can retire after 30 years of work and receive 90% of their highest compensation. CalPERS member agencies, which includes most cities in the state, reduced that formula as part of modest statewide pension reforms that went into effect in 2013. The median salary (excluding benefits) for a full-time officer in 2018 (the most recent year available) was $110,000, according to the state controller's database on public pay. Once the raises for non-veteran officers kicked in, that would climb to $138,160.See what your police department employees make: Explore the state's database.What else we're readingHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants 11 Confederate statues removed from the U.S. Capitol building.Some Tesla employees in Fremont have tested positive for the coronavirus, but company officials are pretty mum on details. A COVID-19 outbreak at a Ventura long-term care facility infected 36 people and brought two deaths.Wildfire season arrives in Ventura County. What never giving up looks like If you're feeling like the news is pretty heavy right now, maybe you'd find comfort and inspiration in a live storytelling event on Thursday themed, ""Resiliency.""The USA TODAY Network's Storytellers Project will stream the show, part of its virtual season, at 5 p.m. PT.

",2020-06-10T00:00:00,Nathan BomeyUSA TODAY,"Usually around late summer, car dealerships begin trotting out the first batch of new models.This year you'll have to wait.With the coronavirus pandemic slamming the auto industry, certain 2021 vehicles will arrive late as automakers have put the brakes on dozens of debuts.“We’ve seen quite a few delays,” said Jeff Schuster, president of global vehicle forecasts for research firm LMC Automotive.While there’s yet to be a new model canceled publicly, at least 24 redesigned or new North American-built vehicles that were poised to roll out in the coming months won’t come out on time, according to LMC Automotive, which provided a partial list to USA TODAY. They include the Ford F-150, Cadillac Escalade and Acura MDX.Though designers and engineers are largely able to work from home, plant shutdowns and a sales slowdown have caused the delays.2021 Ford F-150:Spy photos reveal first look at Ford's redesigned F-150 pickup2020 production hurdles:Ford faces huge challenge as it launches 4 key models at frantic paceOverall, automakers had planned to launch 38 redesigned or new 2021 model-year vehicles in the 2020 calendar year. A vehicle is generally considered redesigned when its styling, size, chassis, or powertrain have been substantially overhauled.Of those 38, five have already launched, including the Tesla Model Y crossover, while 12 have been delayed within the year and 12 have been pushed into next year, according to LMC.And some are “still at risk to slip into next year,” Schuster said.The highest-profile delay is for the highest-profile vehicle: the Ford F-150.Part of the F-series lineup, which is the best-selling vehicle in America, the F-150 is poised for a total redesign. But Ford is expected to delay the start of production from July to September, according to LMC.Getting the redone F-150 launched as soon as possible is extremely important for Ford’s finances. But the two plants where the vehicle is assembled – one in Missouri and one in Michigan – have each grappled with brief production stoppages due to positive coronavirus tests among workers after they resumed operations following two-month shutdowns.“That’s a substantial launch in a good year and, when everything is normal, a challenging one,” Schuster said.Ford is also expected to delay the rollout of the highly anticipated return of the Ford Bronco SUV, which was set to begin production in December but now won't start until February.Other high-profile delays of production, according to LMC, include:Nissan Frontier: from April 2020 to April 2021.Acura MDX: from May to October.Ford Mustang Mach-E: from July to September.Toyota Sienna 500B: from July to September.Cadillac Escalade: from July to August.Cancellations are unlikely, if only because much of the investment in the redesign and production setup has already been allocated.“They were just too far along to cancel,” Schuster said.Still, while automakers may not abandon redesigned or brand-new vehicles that were in the works, they may decide to eliminate existing models that aren’t selling well to make room for the newcomers amid a sluggish sales environment. They’ve been eliminating poorly selling models in droves in recent years with the cancellation of vehicles like the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus and the Fiat 500.“I do think there’s going to be further trimming of product lines,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst for car-buying site Autotrader.As of late May, about 10% of vehicles on dealer lots were still 2019 models, according to car research site Edmunds.To be sure, dealers aren’t being flooded with vehicle inventory. Production shutdowns during the height of COVID-19 have prevented that from happening.But that means “there just won’t be as many 2020 model years out there” as there usually would be for the current model year, Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell said.Production shutdowns aren’t the only problem for the automakers. The cancellation of the 2020 Detroit auto show and the 2020 New York auto show, plus the inability to organize solo publicity events, is making it difficult for automakers to generate buzz about redesigned models.For example, General Motors was supposed to debut the revived Hummer in May in a bid to give the newly styled GMC-line electric pickup a big boost out of the gate. But that event hasn’t happened.“Automakers are struggling in terms of introducing their vehicles and how to create a high-profile event to get attention,” Caldwell said. “You can’t just be producing vehicles nobody knows about.”Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.",tesla,usatoday,,

",2020-06-05T00:00:00,Paul Bledsoe,"More than 42 million workers have filed unemployment claims during the coronavirus pandemic, the jobless rate is over 13% and minorities are bearing a disproportionate share of the economic pain, just as people have taken to the streets to protest racial injustice — but there's a clear path forward for America. We must create millions of new jobs by investing in an infrastructure-led recovery through federal legislation. Just as we did in the 1930s New Deal and the 1950s Interstate Highway System, in the 1960s through NASA and in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we can rebuild the foundation of America’s economic future while creating millions of jobs today.To be most effective at helping workers, such economic recovery and infrastructure legislation should include large investments in clean manufacturing, which will be the fastest growing manufacturing sector in coming years, attracting $10 trillion in investment globally by 2050. A new report from the Progressive Policy Institute finds that means putting Americans to work building tens of millions of new electric vehicles, charging stations, and creating advanced electric grids, as well as upgrading our roads, bridges, high-speed internet, ports, and public transport.Republicans are stallingThis will require new consumer tax incentives for Americans to buy dozens of U.S.-made advanced energy products like electric vehicles, and direct government purchase of electric buses, trucks, and other new clean technology goods to jump-start private sector jobs, cut pollution and address climate change. We must also train workers in technology and manufacturing skills through high schools and struggling community colleges, focused where unemployment is highest, both in cities and rural areas, in direct cooperation with employers.Democrats in Congress are unified around these goals. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, Joe Biden proposed a $1.3 trillion clean infrastructure plan to boost U.S. jobs creation and manufacturing. Just this week, House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Peter DeFazio introduced major infrastructure legislation as part of a five-year, $760 billion House Democratic framework. Now the economic crisis means these efforts should be expanded, with more job-creating investment.But in Washington, Republicans are stalling. Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has the gall to suggest we can’t afford an economic recovery and jobs bill modernizing our roads, factories and bridges, and making upgrades like high-speed internet available everywhere, even as tens of millions are out of work.Remarkably, the Trump administration has purposely suffocated Democratic attempts to create clean manufacturing jobs. In December, Trump killed congressional efforts to extend electric vehicle tax credits above 200,000 units per company, meaning consumers no longer get $7,500 credit for purchasing GM-produced cars, costing workers jobs and pay checks. Yet the rapid retooling at GM and Ford to build ventilators and masks to address the COVID-19 crisis illustrates the ability of automakers to adapt to new market demands and government incentives.What would FDR do? We need a new WPA to fight massive unemployment in the coronavirus era.Other sectors have similar job-creating opportunities, but are being blocked by Trump. A heating and cooling industry study found that new federal energy efficiency and emissions standards would create 33,000 new American manufacturing jobs making air conditioners and refrigeration products, adding $12.5 billion annually to the economy. But Republicans killed the legislation even though most in Congress support it, and these jobs will otherwise go to China.Trump's broken economic promisesIn his 2016 campaign, Donald Trump famously made two promises: to revitalize American manufacturing, and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. But as president, he has done neither one.In fact, U.S. manufacturing declined deeply during each quarter of 2019, long before the coronavirus onset. The manufacturing collapse was especially severe in the Great Lakes industrial states and now has been compounded by coronavirus-related shutdowns. An analysis by two leading Federal Reserve economists finds that the Trump tariffs are causing U.S. “reductions in manufacturing employment and relative increases in producer prices” while “tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output.”Trump and congressional Republicans have also ignored years of Democratic calls for job-creating infrastructure legislation, instead spending $2 trillion on a massive tax giveaway to corporations and the wealthy that added to our debt without actually helping the real economy and workers.Economics for a post-lockdown world: Invest now to prevent another Great DepressionMeanwhile China continues to walk away with contracts, production and jobs. China controls 73% of the world’s lithium ion electric vehicle battery market, the key electric vehicle technology, compared to the U.S. with just 12% of the battery market. That’s not good enough.America still has time to gain huge market share in electric vehicles and many other clean energy technologies, if we act quickly. But Trump and other Republicans still say there’s “no rush” for economic stimulus.  If Republicans will not act, then Joe Biden and Democrats should make these jobs and economic competitiveness issues a centerpiece of the 2020 election debate. We need a muscular new vision of a clean infrastructure and manufacturing sector with millions of good new jobs that help all Americans. This is the modern equivalent of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “Arsenal of Democracy” — helping to solve many of our economic, employment, manufacturing, trade and environmental problems together.Paul Bledsoe is strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington.

",2020-06-25T00:00:00,From USA TODAY Network and wire reports,"AlabamaMontgomery: As the state continues to fight through the coronavirus pandemic, it is now dealing with workers who are refusing to return to their jobs. Employers have reported 3,336 people to the state for refusing to return to work since January, al.com reported. About a third of those workers were taken off the unemployment rolls and the rest have lost benefits while they are under review, the news site said. “(Bosses) have called the employee back to work and the employee has refused,” said Tara Hutchinson, spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Labor. “So (workers) either have not come or told the employer, ’I’m not coming back.’ ” The volume of “refusal to work” cases being reviewed is unusually high because of the pandemic, she said. The federal CARES Act allows workers impacted by COVID-19 to stay on unemployment under some circumstances. Employees who have the disease or are caring for someone with it cannot lose their unemployment benefits. Caring for a child whose school is closed or dealing with the COVID-19 death of a primary breadwinner are other exceptions under the federal legislation. However, those who simply feel unsafe returning to work are not protected. “A general fear is not a valid reason (to stay home),” Hutchinson said. After the labor department is notified of a “refusal to work” by an employer, it contacts the employer and employee to learn details of the situation and to determine whether to end benefits. The state has so far denied benefits to 909 workers who opted not to return and has stopped benefits to review 2,317 more cases, the news site said.AlaskaJuneau: A man suing the state over plans to distribute federal coronavirus relief aid is asking a judge to block disbursement of a portion set aside for small businesses after Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration reinterpreted the rules. Eric Forrer, contends the money should be spent according to “defined standards,” according to a court filing from his attorney, Joe Geldhof. The filing seeks a court order that would either halt the disbursement of money set aside for businesses until lawmakers approve a “valid expenditure” or block spending of the funds that do not adhere to the “express terms” of a proposal previously ratified by the Legislature. The filing misidentifies the bill number, a typo Geldhof acknowledged. Forrer has maintained the ratification process itself was problematic, citing constitutional concerns. Last week, the state Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development announced eligibility changes to the $290 million program intended to provide additional aid to businesses feeling the economic fallout from the coronavirus. The changes include allowing businesses that received $5,000 or less in certain federal relief funds to become eligible for the state’s grant program, provided they meet other requirements. Alaska received more than $1 billion in federal coronavirus relief aid, $290 million of which the state designated toward a small business program. The program, proposed by the Dunleavy administration and later ratified by the Legislature, excluded businesses that had secured federal program funding directly available to them under a federal coronavirus relief law. Glenn Hoskinson, a special assistant to Alaska’s commerce commissioner, said when the proposal was first drafted, the first round of the federal loan funds had been depleted and the second round hadn’t been made available. Hoskinson said by email the department also was not aware then that businesses were getting partial amounts of funds requested from the federal programs. Hoskinson said last week the Department of Law was looking at how or if the commerce department could amend the eligibility criteria.ArizonaPhoenix: The Arizona Motor Vehicle Division said it is having difficulty keeping up with routine business during the coronavirus pandemic and the agency is asking its customers for patience. The MVD’s parent agency, the state Department of Transportation, said Tuesday the division’s customer service operations are experiencing delays as MVD faces employee absences because of illness and quarantine requirements. Specific impacts cited by the agency include diminished call center operations that mean it can take calls over 30 minutes to reach a representative. Also, the agency said some customers reported that registration tabs take longer than expected to arrive in the mail. ADOT Director John Haliekowski said in a statement that officials are “working hard to find new ways to safely and effectively serve the public.” According to the statement, the updated status of a customer’s vehicle registration or reregistration is recorded as soon as payment is made and that law enforcement agencies have access to MVD’s updated database. The agency also said drivers whose licenses expire between March and September of this year have had the expiration date extended by six months and don’t need to renew until the new date.ArkansasLittle Rock: Three Pulaski County residents on Tuesday asked a state judge to declare that fear of contracting COVID-19 is a valid excuse for voting absentee. The lawsuit also seeks to require the state to conduct a public information campaign about the new rules if their request is granted. If the state doesn’t act now to allow COVID concerns as an excuse or allow no-excuse absentee voting, the lawsuit said, “then it will be too late and Arkansas voters will be forced to choose between their health and their fundamental right to vote.” State law only allows absentee ballots because of illness, physical disability or the voter being unavoidably absent. Gov. Asa Hutchinson waived the requirement for a primary runoff in April because of the pandemic, but has not said whether he will do the same for this year’s election. Secretary of State John Thurston, named as the defendant in the case, said county election officials have told his office they believe the current system will be adequate in the November election. “Our office will continue to work with each county to provide supplies and resources to ensure that the upcoming presidential election is safe and secure,” Thurston said in a statement.CaliforniaLos Angeles: An $800 million plan was unveiled Tuesday to house 15,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County who are considered most vulnerable to the new coronavirus. The county’s Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority presented a three-year COVID-19 recovery plan to the county Board of Supervisors to provide temporary housing with a goal of finding permanent places to live for those on the streets. The money was expected to come mainly from government funding but details would need to be worked out. The U.S., California and local economies have been hammered by the impact of monthlong lockdowns and business shutdowns aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. In April, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Project Roomkey, a mainly federally funded program to provide the capacity to house and, if necessary, isolate people on the street who were most at risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 because of their age or existing health problems. The county aimed to provide for 15,000 people but managed to house about 6,000, including 4,000 who were placed in leased hotel rooms. But some of those leases expire next month. The new proposal would provide various housing measures, including rental subsidies, through next June along with various services. Over the next two years, efforts would be made to move people into permanent housing.ColoradoFort Collins:Larimer County health officials have developed a tool to help residents keep track of COVID-19 cases in the county. Using data collected from various sources, a dashboard on the county’s COVID-19 information website presents a risk score for the disease. As of Tuesday, the score was “medium” based on indicators such as recent numbers for positive cases, testing results and hospitalizations. The dashboard does not represent a “data dump” of all the information available to county and state health officials but shows early warning indicators from the county’s suppression plan for the virus, health department spokesperson Katie O’Donnell told the county commissioners Tuesday. “It’s more focused on the measures that we’re watching to make sure that our hospitals are able to take on a COVID surge should we have one,” O’Donnell said. Data provide by local health care systems include the number of patients hospitalized with COVID and percentages for the usage of hospitals and intensive care units. Hospital data will be updated three times a week, and other data will be updated daily. County residents have done a good job of “flattening the curve” of the pandemic, but the coronavirus has not gone away, officials said. Precautions such as wearing face coverings, washing hands regularly, social distancing, increased testing, and close-contact tracking will help to slow the spread of the virus. The dashboard can be viewed at larimer.org/covid-dashboard. Information on the numbers of positive COVID cases, deaths and outbreaks in the county also can be found on the site.ConnecticutHartford: The Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles on Tuesday partially reopened four of its branches to begin offering in-person licensing and new vehicle registration services by appointment only, the latest in a series of steps toward resuming operations at one of the state’s busiest agencies. Road testing also resumed Tuesday, in partnership with private driving schools, to reduce a backlog of approximately 1,000 road tests that developed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. They have now been rescheduled through June 30. “Who would have thought everybody was missing DMV so much,” joked Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, as he stood outside the Waterbury branch where DMV customers with prescheduled appointments waited in their cars until being notified electronically to come inside the building. Branches in Bridgeport, Enfield and New Britain also partially reopened Tuesday for new registration and license services. New registration services will begin June 30 at the Wethersfield, Willimantic, and Danbury branches. All in-person services, including out-of-state license and registration transfers, and commercial driver’s license upgrades, now require an appointment which can be made online. Meanwhile, additional locations reopened Tuesday for learner’s permit knowledge tests. Offices in Wethersfield and Cheshire previously opened May 11 as part of a pilot program. Now, the tests will also be offered at offices in Willimantic, Old Saybrook, Norwalk, and Danbury by appointment only.DelawareGreenwood:The Delaware Army National Guard’s 1049th Transportation Company helped the Food Bank of Delaware distribute food to the needy amid the coronavirus pandemic at drive-thru mobile pantries on Monday. About 25 soldiers and airmen from the National Guard joined volunteers during a drive-thru mobile pantry at Woodbridge High School in Greenwood distributing food amid COVID-19. The unit also helped to distribute food at St. George’s Technical High School in Middletown on June 19. The Delaware Air National Guard’s 142nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron and 166th medical group also assisted with drive-thru testing at Central Middle School in Dover on June 17 and the National Guard Medical Attachment aided in drive-thru testing at Long Neck Middle School in Millsboron and, with Epworth Food Rescue, at Epworth United Methodist Church in Rehoboth Beach on June 16.District of ColumbiaWashington:The District reported an additional 34 cases of the novel coronavirus and four additional deaths on Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported. That brings the District’s total to 10,128 cases and 541 lives lost. The District is in Phase 2 of reopening, meaning restaurants and nonessential retail can open indoors at 50% capacity and gyms and yoga studios can reopen with restrictions.FloridaTallahassee:The Florida Division of Emergency Management is testing all employees at the State Emergency Operations Center for COVID-19 after a vendor, who recently had been in the building, tested positive for the virus. “All individuals who were in close contact were tested (Tuesday), and all tested negative,” said Jason Mahon, communications director for the division. Mahon said the vendor was last been in the building last week. “However, in an abundance of caution and as a good exercise for what the Division might face during a hurricane activation, everyone in the building will be tested,” he said. Mahon did not specify who or what the vendor did at the building, or how many employees are being tested. The operations center in Tallahassee serves as the central clearinghouse for disaster-related information and requests for deployment of assistance, according to its website. The EOC was activated and placed on Level 1 when Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency on March 9, nine days after declaring a public health emergency after the state made public the first two cases of people in the state who contracted the virus. Level 1 is the highest level of activation of the State Emergency Response Team, and means the EOC is fully staffed around the clock.GeorgiaAtlanta: State lawmakers could see their pay cut by 11% under a proposal advancing in the Senate. Lawmakers said they want to give up part of their pay to show they are sharing in the suffering of state agencies, K-12 schools, universities and others that are likely to face 10% budget cuts after state tax revenue fell during the coronavirus pandemic. Senators voted 43-3 on Tuesday to pass House Bill 1094, sending it back to the House for more debate. The bill would cut lawmakers’ yearly salary of more than $17,350 by 11% in the budget year beginning July 1. Lawmakers would still get their full daily expense pay. Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan’s pay of nearly $92,000 a year would be cut by 14%. “It is making a statement that we’re all in this together,” said state Sen. Jeff Mullis, a Chickamauga Republican who earlier presented a bill to study raising salaries. Mullis said the pay cut could leave more money to pay legislative staffers. Duncan publicly volunteered to take the cut earlier, when budget reductions were pegged at 14%. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican, has said that House budget negotiators have agreed, in general, to cut spending in their chamber. Representatives have yet to take a vote on a direct pay cut to themselves, though. Lawmakers are expected to wrap up talks on spending nearly $26 billion in state revenue by Friday.HawaiiHonolulu: The federal census of Hawaii’s homeless residents has been delayed until late September because of the coronavirus pandemic, an official said. U.S. Census Bureau spokeswoman Jeanette Duran said the count of the state’s homeless population was moved to Sept. 22 through Sept. 24, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday. The count was previously scheduled for March 30 through April 1 but was postponed because of state health restrictions. The census conducted every 10 years has the potential to affect Hawaii’s share of $800 billion in federal spending over the next 10 years. The government continues to recruit workers to count homeless people across the islands in encampments, shelters and “laundromats and soup kitchens,” Duran said. Census takers, who are paid $24 an hour, will have personal protective equipment and follow social distancing guidelines to help produce an accurate count of homeless residents, Duran said. The federal government’s census is expected to represent “simply a snapshot of the (homeless) population,” Duran said. In the last nationwide homeless census in 2010, Hawaii led the nation with the largest percentage of homeless people under the age of 18 at 37%, Duran said.IdahoBoise: A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Idaho officials to decide by Friday afternoon whether to put an education funding initiative on the November ballot or allow an additional seven weeks for electronic signature gathering. U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill issued the order after granting a preliminary injunction to Reclaim Idaho, a group that backs citizen initiatives, to temporarily alter the state’s laws for signature gathering. The education funding initiative seeks to raise $170 million for K-12 education by raising Idaho’s corporate tax rate and increasing taxes on individuals making $250,000 a year or higher. Reclaim Idaho in a lawsuit filed earlier this month said that Republican Gov. Brad Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March because of the coronavirus pandemic didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature gathering. The group in the lawsuit against Little and Secretary of State Lawerence Denney, also a Republican, said that violated the First Amendment-protected process of signature gathering, a form of political speech. Winmill in granting the injunction said Reclaim Idaho was likely to win the case and, except for the pandemic, likely would have gathered enough signatures for the initiative to appear on the November ballot. “This decision is a surprising exercise of judicial activism,” Little and Denney said in a statement. “We plan to appeal this decision immediately.” Under Winmill’s ruling, if Idaho doesn’t agree to put the initiative on the November ballot, it will have to extend signature gathering another seven weeks and allow electronic signatures, something never before allowed for ballot initiatives.The state attorney general’s office had argued that granting the injunction would be an intrusion by the judicial branch into the state’s election process.IllinoisSpringfield: Illinois public schools and colleges will open this fall despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with help from the the state to provide 2.5 million face coverings to K-12 students to help prevent transmission of the virus, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday. Pritzker was joined by a group of education administrators in Chicago to announce COVID-19 safety guidelines for community colleges and universities. Illinois has received $569 million in federal pandemic relief funds. The bulk of that will go directly to elementary and secondary schools to handle local needs in response to the outbreak. The Illinois State Board of Education will use $54 million of it to help schools buy laptops and tablets, internet connectivity, virtual coaching for teachers and professional development. “Classroom learning provides necessary opportunities for our students to learn, socialize and grow,” Pritzker said in releasing guidelines for safe classroom learning. “The benefits of in-person instruction can’t be overstated.” On Monday, Pritzker announced that the spread of the illness remains controlled enough to allow the state to move into the fourth of his five-stage Restore Illinois plan for reopening schools and business and lifting some restrictions on social interaction. In schools, staff and students will wear face coverings, and gatherings of more than 50 people will be prohibited. People are advised to social distance by least 6 feet whenever possible. Schools are also expected to ensure that people entering their premises are free of symptoms and increase disinfection of buildings.IndianaIndianapolis:The state’s moratorium on utility disconnections, enacted amid the coronavirus pandemic, will expire July 1, leaving hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers who are more than two months behind on their bills uncertain of what the coming months will bring. Unless Gov. Eric Holcomb extends or amends his executive order in the coming days. In mid-March, several utilities across the state voluntarily suspended disconnections in light of the pandemic that forced businesses to close and left many without jobs. That was solidified by a March 19 executive order in which Holcomb deemed utility providers an essential service and prohibited them from disconnecting service to any customer. As the deadline looms, it remains uncertain if the moratorium will be extended — and, if so, for how long. Not everyone agrees on how to proceed. The state’s utility regulatory commission is studying the pandemic impacts to determine if an extension is necessary. Indiana’s major utility providers are offering to extend it by a month. And the state’s consumer advocates said that’s not long enough. The utilities have not provided any information that shows they are financially unstable because of fee waivers and the disconnection suspension, said Kerwin Olson, executive director of the consumer-advocate group Citizens Action Coalition.IowaIowa City:State regulators said they found no workplace safety violations at Tyson Foods’ largest pork processing plant, which employed several people who died after contracting the novel coronavirus. The Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration closed its inquiry into the Tyson plant in Waterloo earlier this month without sanctioning the meat company. County officials and workers have alleged that in March and part of April, workers did not have adequate personal protective equipment to stop the spread of the virus and were not social distancing. The company said it has taken numerous safety steps since then, including requiring masks, screening for symptoms, and frequent testing. Black Hawk County has said that more than 1,000 of the Waterloo plant’s 2,800 workers had tested positive for the virus or antibodies by early May. The Associated Press has confirmed that at least five workers have died after getting the virus, most recently a 44-year-old maintenance worker who died on Memorial Day after a lengthy illness. The other deaths have included a 65-year-old laundry department worker, a 58-year-old Bosnian refugee, a 60-year-old Latino father and a refugee from Congo. Iowa health officials have not released the number of meatpacking workers who have died because of the virus in Waterloo or at other plants. Iowa OSHA said it inspected the Waterloo plant April 20 after Democratic lawmakers filed a complaint alleging that unsafe working conditions caused the outbreak, which devastated the broader community. Within days, the plant suspended operations and reopened about two weeks later with new safety protocols. Iowa OSHA Administrator Russell Perry said in a letter dated June 11 that his agency found “no violations of the Iowa occupational safety and health standards on the date of the inspection.”KansasTopeka: The city is looking to cut more than 30 jobs next year to deal with a $5 million budget deficit resulting from efforts to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. City Manager Brent Trout on Tuesday proposed cutting 32 full-time position and reducing at least one position to part time in 2021. The mayor and City Council will consider the proposal before completing the budget in August. Public works director Jason Peek recommended reducing his department’s workforce alone by 14 jobs, the Capital-Journal reported. The proposed cuts come as reduced sales tax revenues caused by businesses shutting down or cutting back to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have left the city struggling to balance its budget for this year. Trout has already furloughed 147 nonunion employees and eliminated jobs held by deputy city manager Doug Gerber, neighborhood relations director Sasha Haehn and emergency management coordinator Jim Green to deal with the current year’s deficit. The city anticipates using between $1.9 million and $7.2 million from its reserve fund to balance this year’s budget.KentuckyLouisville:The 2020 WFPK Waterfront concert season was canceled Wednesday because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to officials. The free concert series at Louisville’s Waterfront Park has showcased local and up-and-coming national artists annually since 2002. But the pandemic, which has led to the cancellation of countless other events and music festivals this year, has not gone away and has forced organizers to pull the plug on this year’s Waterfront Wednesday series. Waterfront Park and WFPK said the series will plan to restart in the spring of 2021.“WFPK Waterfront Wednesday is a thriving institution that has brought the community together for two decades,” WFPK Program Director Stacy Owen said in a news release. “We take pride in presenting this concert series at a high level of quality, which would not be possible at this time. We look forward to welcoming everyone back to the Big 4 Lawn for WFPK Waterfront Wednesday when the time is right.”LouisianaBaton Rouge: Louisiana K-12 schools and colleges would receive sweeping protections against civil lawsuits from students and teachers who contract an infectious disease, including COVID-19, under a bill that won overwhelming support Tuesday from the state House. The measure by Republican Rep. Buddy Mincey, a former Livingston Parish School Board member, would keep people exposed to an infectious disease at a school or school facility from being able to sue for damages unless they can prove the high legal standard of “grossly negligent or wanton or reckless misconduct.” The protections would be given to public and private K-12 schools; charter schools; and public and private colleges and universities. Mincey said the limitation from liability was critical to allow schools to offer in-person classes in the upcoming school year without fear of lawsuits because of COVID-19. He said classes on a campus, rather than through distance learning, are better for students. “If we don’t provide reasonable liability protections for our schools … my fear is they’re going to say, ‘I’ll see you online,’” Mincey said. The bill is retroactive to March 11, around the time of Louisiana’s first positive coronavirus test. But it wouldn’t only apply to the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus. It would apply to any declared state emergency for an infectious disease. The House voted 82-17 for the proposal, sending it to the Senate for debate despite concerns it could put teachers and students at greater risk of exposure because campuses will be shielded from most lawsuits. “I’m just in favor of erring on the side of fighting for our children,” said Rep. Gary Carter, a New Orleans Democrat who opposed the measure. “I think this legislation reduces the protection of our children for the benefit of our schools.”MainePortland: Maine’s public university system plans to avoid a tuition increase related to its response to the coronavirus pandemic, officials said Wednesday. The University of Maine System began considering its fiscal 2021 budget on Wednesday. The proposal includes a long-planned 2.5% tuition increase, but it does not include any additional tuition or fee increases caused by the pandemic, said system spokesman Dan Demeritt. The cost of responding to the pandemic at Maine’s public universities will likely be more than $20 million in the coming budget year, Demeritt said. He said the pandemic will “have a big impact on operations and revenues this academic year,” but the system will still be ready for students in the fall.MarylandOcean City:Organizers of the White Marlin Open went before the Town Council on Tuesday to ask the town to issue a letter supporting the event as staff continue to work with local and state officials to get the necessary approvals for the August fishing tournament. Event organizers wanted to have the support of the council if the COVID-19 safety guidelines continue to change, said Joseph Moore before the council’s work session on Tuesday. Tournament planners don’t intend to cancel the 2020 event and will comply with all COVID-19 safety guidelines, said Moore. “If for instance, another agency has to weigh in on approval, we want them to know that we have gone to the mayor and council of Ocean City to get their support,” Moore said. The organizers of the White Marlin Open asked Ocean City leaders to issue a “letter of support” for the event because its a “significant economic driver for the town of Ocean City,” according a letter Moore sent to Mayor Rick Meehan. During the council meeting, Moore went into detail about how organizers will keep spectators safe during the event. “We have filed an application with the Ocean City Parks and Recreation Department requesting the use of the base side of Third Street ballfield for the purpose of having a virtual view of the White Marlin Open to limit the number of people who would come otherwise to Harbor Island,” Moore said.MassachusettsBoston: The leadership of a home for aging veterans in Massachusetts where nearly 80 residents sickened with the novel coronavirus have died made “substantial errors and failures” as the disease began to spread, likely contributing to the high death toll, according to an independent investigation released Wednesday. The superintendent of the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home was not qualified to manage a long-term care facility and he and his leadership team made decisions that were “utterly baffling from an infection-control perspective,” the report said. Among them was a decision to move veterans from one dementia unit into another, both of which housed veterans who already had the virus. “Rather than isolating those with the disease from those who were asymptomatic – a basic tenet of infection control – the consolidation of these two units resulted in more than 40 veterans crowded into a space designed to hold 25. This overcrowding was the opposite of infection control; instead, it put those who were asymptomatic at even greater risk of contracting COVID-19,” the report said. The investigation was conducted by former federal prosecutor Mark Pearlstein, who was hired by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. “This report lays out in heartbreaking detail the terrible failures that unfolded at the facility, and the tragic outcomes that followed,” Baker said in an emailed statement. “Our emergency response to the COVID-19 outbreak stabilized conditions for residents and staff, and we now have an accurate picture of what went wrong and will take immediate action to deliver the level of care that our veterans deserve.” The home’s superintendent, Bennett Walsh, has defended his response and accused state officials of falsely claiming they were not notified quickly enough about the spread of the virus. He was placed on administrative leave March 30 and the CEO of Western Massachusetts Hospital, Val Liptak, took over operations. An email seeking comment was sent to Walsh’s attorney Wednesday.MichiganLansing: The state would create dedicated facilities for coronavirus-infected patients who are not sick enough to be hospitalized or placed in a nursing home under a bill approved Wednesday by the state Senate. The Republican-sponsored legislation is a response to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s policy that allows people with COVID-19 to be put in nursing homes if they are isolated from residents without the virus. Under the measure, people could not stay in a nursing home or be admitted there unless they have recovered from the virus or the home can provide a designated area for them. Initially, the bill would have prohibited the transfer of COVID-19 patients into nursing homes, but the language was relaxed. The Senate sent the legislation to the House on a 24-13 vote, with two Democrats joining all Republicans in support.MinnesotaMinneapolis: The 2020 Twin Cities Marathon will switch to a virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic, marathon organizers said. Entrants in the 39th edition of the Minneapolis-to-St. Paul race can run any 26.2-mile route any day in October. Twin Cities in Motion, which stages the marathon, said it will shift the rest of its 2020 races to a virtual format because of pandemic-related restrictions on large gatherings. Runners will submit their times online, and race finishers still will receive their T-shirt and medal, the Star Tribune reported. The marathon was scheduled for Oct. 4. As many as 30,000 runners were expected to participate in marathon weekend events. Twin Cities in Motion does not expect Minnesota’s limits on large group gatherings to loosen up much before October, said the group’s president, Mike Logan. Race organizers hoped they could conduct the event safely but came to believe that was not possible after consulting with public health authorities and the race’s medical directors, Logan said. Other marathons in recent months, including Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth, also have switched to a virtual format.MississippiJackson: As the state saw its highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases Tuesday, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, said he is not “remotely surprised” and expressed concern for the future. “We’ve been seeing this trend evolving over weeks,” Dobbs said in an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday night. “ As people have tried to embrace normal, but unsafe normal, it is permitting the virus to spread. We’re really going to end up paying the price for it.” The Mississippi Department of Health reported 611 new cases and 11 deaths Tuesday. Dobbs said the uptick is driven by community transmission of the virus from younger, asymptomatic people to their older relatives. “If you drive around and look at how younger people are having social gatherings, they’re crowding into bars, it’s just not safe,” Dobbs said. “People are not complying, people are not wearing masks. It’s not a joke. Really bad things are going to happen.” Dobbs said a big concern of his is the stress the new cases are putting on Mississippi’s heath care system. He said it’s already testing the state’s hospital bed capacity.MissouriColumbia: The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday sent a lawsuit seeking widespread absentee voting during the coronavirus pandemic back to a lower court for review. Judges ruled that Cole County Circuit Court Jon Beetem was wrong to dismiss the case and made a mistake by weighing in on the merits of the lawsuit at that stage. At issue is how voting will work this year as public health officials urge people to social distance to avoid spreading COVID-19. Under a new law, people considered at-risk of the coronavirus – those age 65 and older, living in a long-term care facility or with certain existing health problems – can vote absentee without needing to have their ballot notarized this year. Anyone else can cast a mail-in ballot but would need to get it notarized. An executive order allows virtual notarization through the August primary. But civil rights groups said that’s not enough to protect voting rights during the pandemic. The ACLU of Missouri and the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition sued, arguing everyone should be allowed to vote absentee without a notary. Supreme Court judges didn’t weigh in on that argument.MontanaHelena: Montana has reported 136 new cases of COVID-19 in the past week, including a nursing home resident in Billings and a firefighter in Missoula. The state has reported 248 cases, or nearly one-third of its known 766 cases, since June 1, when it entered its second phase of reopening the economy. Twenty-three cases were discovered from among more than 1,100 tests run on Tuesday. State officials have said increased testing and lifting restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the virus were expected to lead to increased case numbers, in part because of catching asymptomatic cases. However, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has increased from one on June 5 to 17 on Tuesday. The state has 174 people known to be infected with COVID-19, 571 people are considered recovered and 21 people have died. Avantra Billings confirmed Wednesday that a resident tested positive after questions from The Billings Gazette. “The facility is unsure where our resident came into contact with a carrier of COVID-19,” regional director of operations Michael Speidel said. The resident was admitted to Avantra from a hospital on June 17 and transferred back to the hospital Monday, where the person tested positive for COVID-19. “We are nonetheless taking full precautionary measures at the facility.” No one else working or living at the facility has tested positive, Speidel said. A new case confirmed Monday involved a Missoula firefighter, city officials said. The health department has identified the firefighter’s potential contacts, including law enforcement and ambulance personnel, and they will be quarantined at home.NebraskaOmaha: The Douglas County Board has allocated more than $13 million of federal coronavirus relief funding to the county health department, which serves Nebraska’s largest city of Omaha. Among the funding approved Tuesday is $1.3 million for a mass vaccination program in the region as soon as a vaccine is available. Another $4.9 million would be made available if needed for that effort. Douglas County Health Director Adi Pour said it makes sense to allocate the money now for mass vaccination – even though there is no vaccine for the virus – so that health officials can hit the ground running as soon as a vaccine is available. The department can begin preparing by buying medical equipment and supplies and having money available for extra nurses, doctors and other staff when a vaccine becomes available, Pour said. The money could also be used to set up drive-through vaccination clinics and mobile neighborhood vaccine vans.NevadaReno: Leaders of a rural Nevada church are asking a federal appeals court to overturn the state’s COVID-19 cap on the size of religious gatherings that they said treats them more severely than casinos and other secular activities in violation of the U.S. Constitution. Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley in Lyon County wants the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to temporarily invalidate Nevada’s 50-person limit on church services while the court considers whether to strike it down altogether. A federal judge in Las Vegas refused for the third time last week to grant the church a temporary injunction suspending the cap and subjecting religious gatherings to the same rules limiting crowds to 50% of capacity at casinos, restaurants, bars, gyms and theme parks. Calvary Chapel wants to allow 90 people in the 200-capacity sanctuary east of Reno. “The church asks for no special favors,” its attorneys wrote in Monday’s appeal. “It just desires to hold gatherings at 50% capacity with social distancing and safety precautions the same as many businesses where large groups gather in close proximity for extended periods of time. Unless this court intervenes, Nevada will continue putting a thumb on the scales against the free exercise of religion.”New HampshireConcord: Housing industry experts in New Hampshire are warning that evictions could spike later this summer when tenant protections and enhanced unemployment benefits resulting from the coronavirus pandemic lapse. New Hampshire’s eviction moratorium expires July 1 and the federal eviction ban under the CARES Act stops on July 25. The extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits under the CARES Act ends July 31. That poses challenges for tenants, the Caledonian-Record reported. Many have lost jobs during the pandemic and relied on state and federal assistance. “We’re very much in a position of waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said Ben Frost of the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority during a call on housing needs led by U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan on Monday. “It seems like August is when we’re likely to see this perfect storm come together. You can see the radar, you can see it coming.” Nearly half of the renters in New Hampshire were spending 50% or more of their income on housing before the outbreak. New Hampshire plans to distribute $35 million in CARES Act funds for housing relief, half the “conservative estimate” that the state Housing Finance Authority recommended.New JerseyTrenton: Aquariums, libraries, museums and some indoor recreation can reopen July 2, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. Masks will be required and capacity must be limited to 25%, the Democratic governor said during a news conference. The indoor recreation businesses cleared to reopen are bowling alleys, batting cages and arcades, the governor said, though they must also limit capacity to a quarter and require masks for patrons and workers. Gyms and fitness centers can reopen July 2, but only for individual training sessions, he said. Murphy also said New Jersey Transit’s rail and light rail will resume weekday service July 6. Murphy’s announcements came the same day the Democratic governors of New York and Connecticut joined him to require people traveling to those states from others with high coronavirus rates to isolate for two weeks. There were roughly 300 new positive cases reported in New Jersey since Tuesday, Murphy said, putting the overall figure at 170,000. The death toll grew by 48 to 12,995.New MexicoAlbuquerque: Lovelace Women’s Hospital in Albuquerque denies that extra scrutiny was given to pregnant Native American patients amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit some tribal communities in the American Southwest particularly hard. In New Mexico, just over half of the cases are among Native Americans. State officials called for an investigation after the online publications New Mexico In Depth and ProPublica reported that several unidentified clinicians at the hospital alleged that pregnant Native American women were singled out for COVID-19 testing and separated from newborns after delivery while their test results were pending. The clinicians said regardless of symptoms, the women were designated as under investigation for coronavirus based on their appearance and whether their ZIP code was on a list of those that included tribal communities around the state. State investigators who conducted a survey on behalf of the federal Medicaid agency found what was described as “noncompliance” with certain conditions that govern patient rights and participation, said David Morgan, a spokesman for the state Health Department. Although the hospital is awaiting the report from federal officials, Lovelace spokeswoman Serena Pettes said there was no secret policy for screening pregnant women at the hospital. “Every patient, visitor, provider and staff member are screened for COVID-19,” she said.New YorkAlbany: Malls, movie theaters and gyms will not be cleared to reopen when areas of the state progress to Phase 4 as early as Friday. The businesses had been hoping Gov. Andrew Cuomo would allow them to open their doors after a three-month shutdown bought on by the coronavirus pandemic. But the decision, first reported by the Times-Union of Albany, leaves business owners uncertain of when they will be able to welcome back customers. A spokesman for Cuomo on Wednesday cited recent surges in states that have allowed a wide range of businesses to reopen. “There are some things that don’t fit neatly into a phase that are going to require further study and we’re going through that right now. This includes evaluating what’s going on in other states to avoid going backwards,” spokesman Richard Azzopardi wrote in an email. Areas of the state are phasing in reopenings on different timetables. The Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley, Finger Lakes and North Country could move to Phase 4 on Friday, which would allow an easing of restrictions on higher education and “low-risk” arts and entertainment. New York City entered Phase 2 this week. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced late Tuesday that the city’s municipal beaches will open for swimming, with lifeguards, on July 1. Until now, people have only been allowed on the sand.North CarolinaRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper said Wednesday that people across the state must wear masks or other face coverings in public to fight the spread of COVID-19, and he extended other restrictions by three more weeks to fight a surge in coronavirus cases. Cooper issued an executive order that people must wear face coverings in public when it’s not possible to maintain physical distance. The order also mandates face coverings for employees of businesses including retailers and restaurants, as well as state employees in the executive branch. Violations of Cooper’s executive orders are punishable by misdemeanor. He also said restrictions limiting capacity at retailers, restaurants and public gatherings will remain in place for three more weeks. The order comes as the state reported its second-highest one-day jump in virus cases at around 1,700. About 900 people are hospitalized, also representing the second-highest mark in that category. Cooper said the state has sufficient hospital capacity, but that could quickly change if virus trends don’t improve.North DakotaFargo: Gov. Doug Burgum said Tuesday that several counties in the state are close to reaching the fifth and final stage of a reopening plan that would allow businesses to resume normal operations under standard precautions to minimize risk of the novel coronavirus. Burgum said the state’s color-coded risk assessment plan ranks the state as a whole in the fourth or green stage, which is generally considered low-risk but limits bars and restaurants to less than 100% capacity. He said officials will make another assessment next month on how many counties have qualified to move into the fifth or blue stage. “We may get to a spot before the end of the summer where the whole state can move in one swoop from green to blue,” Burgum said at his first COVID-19 briefing in a week. “The primary situation in terms of what may be holding them back … has to do with the percentage of occupancy indoors and outdoors in restaurants and the size of gatherings at large events.” The governor said several restaurants have developed new business plans along with city officials to include more outdoor seating, including placing tables on sidewalks. “There are very few things that are (still) affected. Full seating inside a bar and restaurant is one of those things,” Burgum said. “A number of people are reporting that they are doing great takeaway business. Even this last weekend, I heard some restaurants in the state were doing business on Saturday like it was Valentine’s Day or some other huge event.”OhioCincinnati:The number of coronavirus cases is surging faster than ever in Hamilton County and Cincinnati, prompting leaders to urge the public to wear masks and not gather in large groups. “We suspect people have gotten relaxed,” said Hamilton County Board of Commissioner President Denise Driehaus. “The suspicion is people have let their guard down.” Hamilton County recorded its highest single-day total of new COVID-19 cases on June 18 with 132 new cases. Between June 16 and June 19, Hamilton County had more than 100 new cases a day. The county only had one day with 100 new cases in the four months prior. The city of Cincinnati has seen a striking upswing in the illness caused by the novel coronavirus within the last week, culminating with a 100%-plus jump in new cases in one day. The city’s dashboard count tracking the virus showed COVID-19 cases increasing from 45 on Sunday to 97 on Monday, then dropping again, but still high with 40 new cases reported on Tuesday. Although increased testing accounts for some of the spikes, it doesn’t account for such large increases, Driehaus and Hamilton County Public Health Commissioner Greg Kesterman said.OklahomaOklahoma City: State health officials on Wednesday reported a record one-day spike in the number of positive COVID-19 cases, with 482 positive tests reported in the last 24 hours. That’s the third day in the last week the state reported record one-day increases, including the previous high of 478 new cases on Sunday and 450 on Thursday, according to State Department of Health numbers. The agency also reported an additional COVID-19 death on Wednesday, a Garfield County woman in the 36-to-49 age group. That brings Oklahoma’s statewide death toll to 372 and the total number of confirmed positive cases to more than 11,510. The actual number of people who have contracted the virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.OregonSalem:Lawmakers, most wearing masks and trying to maintain social distance, began a special session Wednesday to crack down on police brutality and throw a lifeline to those suffering financially from the novel coronavirus. “This is a catastrophic disaster session,” Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, told a news conference on Zoom, saying racial discrimination, police brutality and “a monster disease that won’t let us out” must be dealt with. Draft measures would mandate rent protections during the coronavirus emergency and prohibit a lender from treating a borrower’s failure to make loan payment as a declaration of default. They would also prohibit law enforcement officers from limiting the ability of a person to breathe, create a statewide online database of discipline records, prevent an arbitrator from reducing punishments for officers, ban the use of tear gas on protesters and allow the state attorney general to investigate and prosecute when officers kill or seriously injure a person. Some pushback was expected from law enforcement groups. “My hope is that decisions will be made based upon facts, evidence and data, not on emotions, politics or perception,” Jim Ferraris, president of the Oregon Association of Chiefs of Police and police chief of Woodburn, told a joint panel Tuesday..PennsylvaniaHarrisburg: Confirmed coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania now exceed 83,000, and there are 54 new reports of coronavirus-related deaths, many if not all of them who were residents of nursing homes or personal-care homes, the state Department of Health said Wednesday. The department reported 495 new infections. The 54 new deaths brings the statewide total to 6,515. The department’s death toll for nursing homes or personal-care homes rose by 57 on Wednesday as the agency reconciles information it has gathered from various sources in recent days, it said. The total death toll in those facilities is now 4,467, or nearly 70% of Pennsylvania’s total deaths attributed to the outbreak. The number of new infections reported over the last week, 3,373, is virtually the same as the number for the previous seven-day period, 3,382. Both of those figures are slightly higher than the seven-day period before that, through June 9, when the state reported 3,031 new infections. However, the percentage of positive tests has steadily dropped, from 6% for the seven days ending June 9 to 4.5% over the last seven days. Of those residents infected since early March, 77% have recovered, the department said. The number of infections is thought to be far higher than the state’s confirmed case count because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.Rhode IslandProvidence: The coronavirus pandemic is expected to cost the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority up to $80 million in lost ridership revenue over the next five years, agency officials said. The state’s bus operator had been losing riders even before the pandemic, which triggered a huge shift to working from home. Fixed-route bus ridership fell 67% last month compared with May 2019, according to figures presented to the RIPTA board of directors, the Providence Journal reported. April ridership was down 72% year over year. The agency expects to get $91 million in federal stimulus money to make up for the losses.South CarolinaCharleston: Nancy Mace, the Republican nominee in a heavily contested U.S. House race, said she has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Mace sent an email to supporters saying she learned some members of her campaign were potentially exposed to the virus last week and she took a rapid test Tuesday that came back positive. Mace said she is going into quarantine with her children for two weeks or until she tests negative for COVID-19. Mace said she tried to find every person she has been in contact with the past week and is asking volunteers and staff to get tested and start working remotely. Mace’s opponent in November, U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, also tested positive for COVID-19 in late March. The Democrat reached out to Mace on Twitter, saying he was thinking about Mace, her family and her campaign. “This virus is rough but my family and team are here if you need anything at all,” Cunningham said.South DakotaSioux Falls:The number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Dakota remained stable Wednesday, while the state reported one additional death and 66 new positive test results. The number of reported deaths stood at 84 and the number of people hospitalized for the disease remained at 85. So far, 6,419 residents have tested positive for the virus. Of the 66 new cases reported, 13 were in Minnehaha County and one in Lincoln County. Beadle and Pennington counties each recorded nine new cases. Brown County reported three additional cases. The 66 cases came from 1,091 new tests. The 66 new cases outpaced new recoveries by nine cases. The state has 781 cases, a number that has been trending downward. Hospitalizations are a key metric that experts are watching in the pandemic. Hospitalizations in South Dakota reached a high of 106 on May 26. Three percent of the state’s hospital beds were being used by a COVID-19 patient in Wednesday’s report, and 52% of beds were open. Intensive care unit beds were at 29% availability. COVID-19 patients occupied 7% of ICU beds.TennesseeWilson County:A state of emergency was declared in Wilson County on Wednesday because of a recent increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The declaration also “strongly encourages” residents to wear masks when in public, according to a statement from Mayor Randall Hutto, whose initial statement said wearing masks in public would be a requirement. “We want people to stay safe as they resume activities,” Hutto said. “We are requiring people to wear masks when out in public. We ask all businesses to take this very seriously to keep their customers and staff safe by reconsidering the number of people in the area and by requiring masks in stores and businesses.” But early Wednesday afternoon, Hutto’s office said a requirement to wear masks cannot be enforced and that no arrests would be made for not wearing one. “We want to emphasize to take all precautions,” Hutto said. Wilson County’s last state of emergency went through May 18 before it expired, according to the mayor’s office. Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey identified Wilson County as a hot spot Tuesday because of the county’s recent uptick in COVID-19 transmissions. The county had 649 confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday, according to the state. The number of new COVID-19 cases in Wilson County had gone up seven straight days through Tuesday, according to the mayor’s office.TexasDallas: A North Texas man was arrested Tuesday after a federal indictment accused him of applying fraudulently for $3 million from the federal coronavirus relief fund. Federal prosecutors said Fahad Shah, 44, of Murphy was arrested on three counts of wire fraud, one count of making false statements to a bank and four counts of money laundering. A federal indictment accuses the suburban Dallas man of fraudulently applying for $3 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans. The indictment said he got more than $1.5 million that he used to buy a Tesla and make personal investments and home mortgage payments. It was not immediately clear if Shah was kept in custody or released. A telephone number listed to him has been disconnected and he could not be reached for comment.UtahSalt Lake City: A state official has apologized after a family was sent masks featuring a gun, the American flag and the phrase “don’t tread on me” as part of a program offering free face coverings during the coronavirus pandemic. Ben Hart, the deputy director of the governor’s office of economic development, said it was a mistake and that the design was one of about 150 that were identified as potentially controversial, KUTV-TV reported. “It was one of the masks that we were pulling out. These are masks that we have not been distributing; it slipped by us,” Hart said. The office has sent out 1.8 million free masks in the first two months of the program, with another 500,000 expected to be sent out soon, Hart said. Christine Passey-Spencer of Salt Lake City received the masks this week after ordering them from a state website two months ago, she said. “It doesn’t seem possible that it came from the state of Utah,” Passey-Spencer said, adding that she is upset that any sort of political imaging would be put on masks distributed by the state. Michael Mower, Gov. Gary Herbert’s chief of staff, drove to her home Tuesday to personally deliver a pair of new masks, which she said she does appreciate, KSL-TV reported. The masks are intended to help limit the spread of COVID-19.VermontBennington: Bennington College, which closed its campus to the public in March amid the coronavirus pandemic, has reopened its outdoor public spaces, including walking trails, to visitors. Visitors are asked to allow at least 6 feet of space between them and others and to wear a mask while interacting with other people on campus, the Bennington Banner reported Monday. Parking is available at various sites for walkers and people using the tennis and basketball courts. The school is asking people to leash dogs and clean up after their pets. All campus buildings remained closed the public.VirginiaRichmond: A moratorium on evictions in response to the coronavirus pandemic has been lifted by the Supreme Court of Virginia, paving the way for eviction proceedings to resume next week. The ban was originally put in place in March and was extended earlier this month. It is set to expire Sunday. An order issued by the state’s high court Monday said courts might resume hearing eviction cases on June 29. Tenant advocates said thousands of families that are struggling financially because of COVID-19 could be affected. “When you look at the unemployment numbers, those are astronomical, so I imagine that a lot of landlords may not have filed because courts were closed to evictions, and now they may step forward to do so,” said Elaine Poon, a managing attorney with the Legal Aid Justice Center. Poon said advocates are calling on Gov. Ralph Northam to issue an executive order to prevent landlords from moving forward on eviction proceedings in court. “We’re not asking for an indefinite moratorium. We’re asking for enough time to establish a robust rent relief program – one that is sufficiently funded and addresses all of the needs of Virginia,” Poon said. Northam asked earlier this month that the eviction ban be extended to give his administration time to announce a rent relief program. Northam’s spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky, said Tuesday that the administration is in the process of completing the program and plans to roll it out on Monday.WashingtonOlympia: The state will require people to wear facial coverings in public settings, under a public health order announced Tuesday by Gov. Jay Inslee in response to ongoing COVID-related health concerns. The order, issued by Secretary of Health John Wiesman, takes effect Friday. The order requires face coverings when people are indoor in a public area, and outdoors in a public area when 6 feet of physical distancing can’t be maintained. Washington joins several other states that have statewide mask orders in place, including California, which issued its order last week. Yakima County, which has been among the areas hardest hit by the outbreak, has even more stringent requirements under a separate proclamation issued by Inslee that also takes effect Friday. In addition to being covered by the statewide mandate on masks in public, there will now be a legal requirement that prohibits people from entering a place of business – either indoors or outdoors – without first donning a mask. Under that same proclamation, businesses in the central Washington county are prohibited from allowing a customer to enter a business, or conduct business with a customer in any public space unless the customer is wearing a face covering. There are exemptions for children under the age of 2 and for people who are deaf or have hearing loss. Facial coverings for children between the ages of 3 and 5 are strongly recommended, but not required under the orders. People engaged in recreation alone or with household members and those eating out at restaurants wouldn’t have to wear masks as long as they are properly distanced from others. The statewide order builds on a previous one from Inslee, that – since June 8 – has required workers to wear facial coverings unless they don’t interact with others on the job.West VirginiaCharleston: West Virginia is again down to one county with no confirmed coronavirus cases. Health officials in Webster County said Tuesday the county has recorded its first positive virus case. That leaves Doddridge County as the only one among the state’s 55 counties without a confirmed case. Doddridge County, located in the north-central part of the state, has a population of about 8,400 residents. It is one of a dozen counties with populations below 10,000. Webster County had reported a positive case last month but it was later determined the case belonged to another county. There are at about 2,600 coronavirus cases in the state with at least 92 deaths.WisconsinMadison: Nearly every inmate and worker in a Wisconsin prison who tested positive for COVID-19 has recovered, the state Department of Corrections reported Monday. Of the 268 inmates who tested positive, 261 have recovered. There are six active cases and one who was released, the department said. Among prison staff, there were 66 positive cases and 63 have recovered. There are three active cases. Most of the cases among inmates, 228, were at the Waupun Correctional Institution. The state’s prisons were 22% above capacity as of Friday. Waupan, designed for 882 inmates but housing 1,204, was 36% above capacity. The recovery rates within the state’s prisons so far are better than in the general population. According to the state Department of Health Services, so far 3% of those who have tested positive have died. “The entire DOC staff and especially our Emergency Operations Center team took proactive steps to protect both staff members and the persons in our care,” said Corrections Secretary Kevin Carr in a statement. “These latest numbers reflect the tremendous job they have done, so far.” The state health department along with assistance from the Wisconsin National Guard has tested everyone at 22 of the state’s 37 prison facilities so far.WyomingCheyenne: An animal shelter halted pet adoptions and five restaurants sanitized facilities Wednesday amid a spike in coronavirus cases in the state capital. Active coronavirus cases in the Cheyenne area had fallen to zero after peaking over 40 in late April., but on Wednesday, the number was back up to 26. A street festival last weekend that drew hundreds downtown – including many people not wearing masks – heightened health officials’ concern that more yet could fall ill. The Cheyenne Animal Shelter will close for adoptions and surrendering of pets until at least July 5 after an employee tested positive, KTWO Radio reported. Employees caring for animals must have their temperatures taken upon arrival, wear masks when near others and take other protective measures, CEO Sue Castaneda said. Employees at five restaurants – Accomplice Brewing Company, Wyoming Rib and Chop House, Buffalo Wild Wings, Tortilla Factory and Red Lobster – tested positive for the virus, according to the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department. The restaurants were “deep cleaning” and working with health officials to identify infected employees, department Executive Director Kathy Emmons said. The number of active coronavirus cases across Wyoming topped 300 for the first time amid a statewide resurgence. Several counties reported new cases including four in Park County on eastern side of Yellowstone National Park, which until recently had just a couple of cases.",tesla,usatoday,,
