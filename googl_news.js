MLB also arranged for high-frame rate cameras to stream directly to the new replay operations center and ballpark video rooms, and for MLB-controlled 4K cameras with zoom lenses to be installed at high locations behind home plate. A new replay hub about twice the size of the old one was constructed as part of the move of Major League Baseball and MLB Advanced Media to a combined office space in Manhattan, across the street from Radio City Music Hall. “We think that the product of all these items is going to result in a much more rapid review process, so that we’ll be getting video available much more quickly to the umpires, who will be making decision more quickly,” Chris Marinak, MLB executive vice president of strategy, technology and innovation, said Monday. “The same will be true of the replay personnel in the ballpark, who are helping their manager make a decision on whether to challenge.” Each manager will have 20 seconds to decide whether to ask for a video review of a call subject to a challenge, down from 30. MLB’s pandemic-delayed season starts Thursday with the New York Yankees at the World Series champion Washington Nationals. MLB started widespread video review in 2014 after years of embarrassing calls, such as the blown call by first base umpire Jim Joyce that denied Detroit's Armando Galarraga what should have been the final of out a perfect game. There were 1,275 reviews during the 2019 regular season, including 1,051 requested by managers that averaged 1 minute, 46 seconds. Among those calls, 603 (47.3%) were overturned, 310 (24.3%) were confirmed, 352 (27.6%) were allowed to stand and...","publishedDate":"2020-07-20T23:56:34Z","source":"houstonchronicle.com","title":"MLB doubles camera angles for video reviews of umpires","crawlDate":"2020-07-21T00:05:32.508396Z"},{"tags":["Blue Jays","Jays","Mlb","Mlb Restart","Smg2_Sports","Smg_Baseball","Statcast","Stock","Technology"],"id":27260472,"tickers":["goog","googl"],"url":"https://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/2020/07/20/more-mlb-replay-angles-enhanced-statcast-and-simulated-fan-noise-in-play-for-shortened-season.html","description":"From murmurs to cheers to organists, each MLB team will have an iPad with more than 75 sound samples to imitate fan noise when the games begin, starti...","publishedDate":"2020-07-20T23:41:14.998000Z","source":"thestar.com","title":"More MLB replay angles, enhanced Statcast and simulated fan noise in play for shortened season","crawlDate":"2020-07-20T23:50:39.665850Z"},{"tags":["Communication Services","Consumer Cyclical","Docusign","Stock","Technology","Unknown Sector"],"id":27260857,"tickers":["aapl","adbe","docu","fb","goog","googl","msft","nflx","shop","t","zm"],"url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-growth-tech-stocks-buy-233811752.html","description":"Let's look at three growth-focused tech stocks that investors might want to buy at the moment that aren't named Zoom or Tesla...","publishedDate":"2020-07-20T23:38:11Z","source":"finance.yahoo.com","title":"3 Growth Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Not Named Zoom or Tesla","crawlDate":"2020-07-21T00:22:34.015180Z"},{"tags":["Consumer Cyclical","Consumer Defensive","Stock","Stocks In The News","Technology","Unknown Sector"],"id":27260780,"tickers":["aapl","adbe","amzn","docu","fb","googl","msft","nflx","shop","tsla","wmt","zm"],"url":"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1010092/3-growth-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-not-named-zoom-or-tesla?cid=CS-ZC-FT-stocks_in_the_news%7Cinvestment_ideas-1010092","description":"Let's look at three growth-focused tech stocks that investors might want to buy at the moment that aren't named Zoom or Tesla...","publishedDate":"2020-07-20T23:38:00Z","source":"zacks.com","title":"3 Growth Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Not Named Zoom or Tesla","crawlDate":"2020-07-21T00:18:02.911487Z"},{"tags":["2020 Elections","Donald Trump","Facebook","Mark Zuckerberg","Politics","Stock","Tech Policy","Technology","Tiingo Top","Zucc","Zuckerberg"],"id":27260426,"tickers":["goog","googl"],"url":"https://gizmodo.com/zuck-would-these-hips-lie-about-a-secret-deal-with-1844447646","description":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is mostly in the news today for an unflattering photograph of him taken while surfing, slathered in Marilyn Manson-esque levels of sunscreen paired with an unsettlingly perky ass.
